<p>I wrote this term paper in LAW 507: Labor Law and Social Policy. It's pretty dry, but it's worth a read if you like learning how some very technical parts of federal labor law are very outdated in the modern economy, to the detriment of workers' right to organize.</p>
<p><em>Secondary Boycotts in the Fissured Workplace, or, How Leading Firms Get to be "Wholly Unconcerned" With Their Own Workers</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The 1947 Taft-Hartley Act contains a set of provisions designed, in their proponents' words, to prohibit labor organizations from resorting to "a secondary boycott to injure the business of a third person who is <em>wholly unconcerned</em> in the disagreement between an employer and his employees."<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> When the Act was passed, employment was characterized by large firms with stable boundaries and internal labor markets.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> In that context, the secondary boycott provisions were undoubtedly an attempt to weaken unions' bargaining power, but they drew on a distinction---who is one's employer and who is a disinterested third party---that at least arguably existed.</p>
<p>In the last few decades, however, the nature of employment has dramatically changed. Firms that might once have employed huge numbers of workers have begun to outsource that work to a growing network of franchisees, contractors, and subcontractors. These smaller firms' labor relations are largely predetermined by outside factors: Low barriers to entry mean they are subject to intense competition to be the lowest bidder. Meanwhile, the lead firms they do business with often set strict constraints on their business practices. As a result, these employers have strong incentives to cut the only cost they can---labor.</p>
<p>In this context, much of what workers might bargain for---wages, benefits, hours, and working conditions---are effectively dictated by parties other than their direct employer. To use David Weil's term, these workplaces are "fissured."<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> This paper examines the secondary boycott law and its application to two types of fissured workplace: franchises and contractors.</p>
<h2 id="the-secondary-boycott-law">The Secondary Boycott Law</h2>
<p>Section 8(b)(4)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act, along with the supplemental the enforcement mechanisms in section 303 of the Act, are referred to as the Act's "secondary boycott" provisions, although they do not contain, much less define, the words "secondary" or "boycott."<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> Ordinarily it may be appropriate to begin discussion of a law with the statutory language itself; however, the language in question "has been vividly but accurately characterized as one of the most labyrinthine provisions ever included in a federal labor statute.'"<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>It is thus helpful to begin with the law's purpose and structure. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that the secondary boycott provisions are motivated by Congress's concern for "shielding unoffending employers and others from pressures in controversies not their own."<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> The provisions operate to restrict so-called "secondary boycotts," which have been frequently described as "a combination to influence A by exerting some sort of economic or social pressure against persons who deal with A."<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>However broad this concept may be, Congress did not enact a "sweeping prohibition" of secondary boycotts; rather, section 8(b)(4) "condemns specific union conduct directed to specific objectives."<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> Thus, an illegal secondary boycott occurs only when a labor organization engages in the conduct specified in subsections (i) and (ii) while having the objective described in subsection (B), also known as the "secondary object."<sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> Of the two elements, the secondary object is the one more directly relevant to the problem of fissuring. As such, it is discussed at length in the following sections.</p>
<p>In terms of the proscribed <em>conduct</em>, suffice it to say that section 8(b)(4) bars a "wide range of economic sanctions," including picketing, inducing others to strike, and many forms of boycott.<sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> It must be noted, however, that courts and the Board have found a few specific tactics not to run afoul of the secondary boycott ban.<sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup> A number of unions have used these tactics to great effect, and they should not be discounted.<sup id="fnref:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup> Nevertheless, leeway in this regard does not change that the law treats these activities as secondary, and therefore suspect.</p>
<h3 id="the-secondary-object">The "Secondary Object"</h3>
<p>If fissuring means that lead firms exert the control associated with integrated businesses despite formal separation, the obvious response should be to treat union activity against the lead firm as <em>primary</em>. To the extent that this is possible under the current standard, it takes a circuitous path. Per the statute, a union's conduct has a secondary object when "an object thereof" is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>forcing or requiring any person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of any other producer, processor, or manufacturer, or to cease doing business with any other person, or forcing or requiring any other employer to recognize or bargain with a labor organization as the representative of his employees unless such labor organization has been certified as the representative of such employees under the provisions of section 159 of this title: Provided, That nothing contained in this clause (B) shall be construed to make unlawful, where not otherwise unlawful, any primary strike or primary picketing.<sup id="fnref:13"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of the phrase "an object" means that it is not necessary to find that the proscribed object was the <em>sole</em> object of the union's conduct.<sup id="fnref:14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14">14</a></sup> However, the rest of the the analysis is much less literal, especially with respect to the term, "cease doing business." A union can force someone to cease doing business with another even where the two do not have a business relationship, if it seeks to pressure the neutral one into interceding in its labor dispute with the primary employer.<sup id="fnref:15"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:15">15</a></sup> Moreover, no literal cessation of business is necessary; secondary activities need only seek "to alter the way in which the primary employer traditionally operates."<sup id="fnref:16"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>But in other respects, the Board and the courts depart from the literal text in a narrow direction; if they did not, the secondary boycott provision would ban "primary" strikes protected by section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.<sup id="fnref:17"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17">17</a></sup> Hence, it is necessary to distinguish between primary and secondary activity.</p>
<p>It is said that activity is primary if it is directed only at the employer with whom the union has a bona fide labor dispute.<sup id="fnref:18"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> This "primary" employer is the entity with immediate control over the employment terms and conditions the union is protesting.<sup id="fnref:19"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:19">19</a></sup> Other entities are generally presumed to be neutral, "secondary" employers and are thus protected by the secondary boycott law.</p>
<p>A specific doctrine applies when a union pickets at a location that is shared by the primary employer and one or more secondary employers. In that situation, the picketing is evaluated under the <em>Moore Dry Dock</em> criteria:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> The picketing is strictly limited to times when the <em>situs</em> of the dispute is located on the secondary employer's premises; <strong>(b)</strong> at the time of the picketing the primary employer is engaged in its normal business at the <em>situs</em>; <strong>(c)</strong> the picketing is limited to places reasonably close to the location of the <em>situs</em>; and <strong>(d)</strong> the picketing discloses clearly that the dispute is with the primary employer.<sup id="fnref:20"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:20">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Picketing that fails to meet any one of these criteria suffers a strong, albeit rebuttable presumption of a secondary object.<sup id="fnref:21"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:21">21</a></sup> The Board has at times applied the criteria very strictly, arguably manufacturing failures where none existed.<sup id="fnref:22"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:22">22</a></sup> Moreover, even picketing that meets all four criteria is considered secondary if there is independent evidence of a secondary object.<sup id="fnref:23"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:23">23</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="ally-doctrine-and-the-loss-of-neutrality">Ally Doctrine and the Loss of Neutrality</h3>
<p>Given the broad reach of the term "cease doing business" as noted above, virtually any pressure directed at someone other than one's direct employer will likely be found to have a secondary object. An exception to this rule lies in the "ally doctrine."</p>
<p>Courts and the Board have long held that the secondary boycott provision does not protect "allies" of the primary employer. This view was first articulated in <em>Douds v. Metropolitan Federation of Architects</em>, where a purportedly-neutral subcontractor did business with the primary employer on "terms which cast a shadow of doubt upon the identity of the employer," and during a strike its employees "did work, which, but for the strike of [the primary employer's] employees, would have been done by [the primary employer]."<sup id="fnref:24"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:24">24</a></sup> In view of these facts and the Act's legislative history, the court found that "[m]anifestly it was not an innocent bystander, nor a neutral. It was firmly allied to [the primary employer] and it was its conduct as ally ... which directly provoked the union's behavior."<sup id="fnref:25"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>The reasoning in this case has developed into the ally doctrine, which is generally thought to have two branches. The first branch is known as the "struck work" doctrine, wherein an employer loses its neutral status because, like the contractor in <em>Douds</em>, it performs work that it would not have done <em>but for</em> the strike at the primary employer's facility.<sup id="fnref:26"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:26">26</a></sup> Meanwhile, under the second branch, an employer loses its neutral status if it is so closely integrated with the primary employer that they essentially constitute a "single employer."<sup id="fnref:27"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>The Board has said that the union bears a "heavy burden" in seeking to establish that an employer loses neutral status as a single employer.<sup id="fnref:28"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:28">28</a></sup> single employer status is typically determined based on four factors: (1) interrelation of operations; (2) common management; (3) common or centralized control of labor relations; and (4) common ownership or financial control.<sup id="fnref:29"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:29">29</a></sup> No single factor is controlling, but centralized control of labor relations has been called the "critical" factor, while in recent years common ownership is less important than the others.<sup id="fnref:30"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:30">30</a></sup> Common control must be actual or active, as distinguished from potential control.<sup id="fnref:31"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:31">31</a></sup> However, the fact that day to day labor matters are handled at the local level is not controlling.<sup id="fnref:32"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:32">32</a></sup></p>
<p>At times, the Board has also expressly recognized that an employer can lose its neutral status without resort to either of these branches of the ally doctrine. In <em>Curtin Matheson</em>, the Board stated that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in the final analysis, the question of neutrality cannot be answered by the application of a set of verbal formulae. Rather, the issue can be resolved only by considering on a case-by-case basis the factual relationship which the secondary employer bears to the primary employer up against the intent of Congress as expressed in the Act to protect employers who are "wholly unconcerned" and not involved in the labor dispute between the primary employer and the union.
The Board and the courts have thus stressed that the branches of the "ally" doctrine are not to be permitted to take on lives of their own and become encrusted with nice rules and exceptions. They are merely tools that must be used to reflect the full range of congressional policies underlying the primary-secondary dichotomy.<sup id="fnref:33"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:33">33</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since then, <em>Curtin Matheson</em> has generally stood for a flexible application of the the concept of neutrality, albeit one rarely applied.<sup id="fnref:34"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:34">34</a></sup> In some cases, courts and the Board have cited it to the effect that an employer may lose its neutrality by certain conduct, unrelated to struck work, which nevertheless seeks to assist the primary employer in the labor dispute at issue.<sup id="fnref:35"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>However persistent this interpretation, it appears to be the minority view. The Board has at least once indicated that while it is possible for an entity to lose neutral status without being "allied," that is, without performing struck work or being a single employer, this only occurs when the entity exercises "substantial, actual, and active control over the working conditions of the primary's employees."<sup id="fnref:36"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:36">36</a></sup> However, this formulation is also relatively-rare. More often, only the four-factor single employer test is applied.</p>
<h3 id="applicability-of-joint-employer-doctrine">Applicability of Joint Employer Doctrine</h3>
<p>As noted above, <em>Curtin Matheson</em> notwithstanding, many secondary boycott cases treat struck work and single employer status as the only ways to cease being neutral. This is probably incorrect. Though it is infrequently raised, joint employer status has persistently been recognized as an alternative way for an employer to lose neutrality.</p>
<p>Analysis on this point is complicated by the fact that courts and the Board have frequently treated the terms "single employer" and "joint employer" interchangeably.<sup id="fnref:37"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:37">37</a></sup> In 1982, in <em>NLRB v. Browning-Ferris Industries</em> the Third Circuit elaborated on the differences between the two doctrines and noted that, "[a]dmittedly, there has been a blurring of these concepts at times by some courts and by the Board."<sup id="fnref:38"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:38">38</a></sup> This raises the question whether past cases that call "joint employers" non-neutral were in fact applying the single employer doctrine. However, in many cases the Board expressly applies the same joint employer test used in other contexts.<sup id="fnref:39"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:39">39</a></sup> Moreover, although this approach appears to be rare, several Board opinions have applied <em>both</em> the single employer and joint employer tests, expressly treating them as alternative defenses to secondary boycott charges.<sup id="fnref:40"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:40">40</a></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, throughout the recent upheaval in the Board's joint employer standard it has been taken as a given that joint employers are not protected from secondary boycotts.<sup id="fnref:41"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:41">41</a></sup> Significantly, in considering the public comments before issuing its final joint employer rule, the Board expressly stated that a joint employer finding "renders otherwise secondary activity primary."<sup id="fnref:42"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:42">42</a></sup></p>
<p>However, the new rule is unlikely to help workers in fissured employment situations avoid secondary boycott charges. Under the new rule, joint employer status requires "direct and immediate control over one or more essential terms or conditions of ... employment."<sup id="fnref:43"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>Indirect control and reserved-but-never-exercised contractual authority are not sufficient.<sup id="fnref:44"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:44">44</a></sup></p>
<p>"'Essential terms and conditions of employment' means wages, benefits, hours of work, hiring, discharge, discipline, and direction,"<sup id="fnref:45"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:45">45</a></sup> and the rule defines "direct and immediate control" in the context of each.<sup id="fnref:46"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>In doing so, it expressly rules out many of the forms of control most commonly-associated with fissuring: Cost-plus contracts which set maximum reimbursable wage rates are not direct control, nor is setting an enterprise's operating hours, or even telling employees what work to perform when and where, as long as the "how" is omitted.<sup id="fnref:47"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:47">47</a></sup> Moreover, by treating reserved contractual authority as largely irrelevant, the rule ignores the extent to which such authority structures firms' behavior via their fear that it <em>may</em> be exercised.</p>
<p>In sum, although establishing joint employer status is <em>a</em> way to defend against a secondary boycott charge, the Board's recent rulemaking has all but ensured it will not be the best way. It is likely easier to establish a loss of neutrality under the ally doctrine, if only because the disjointed doctrine contains at least a few favorable cases, however sparse and inconsistently-applied they may be.</p>
<h2 id="secondary-boycott-law-and-specific-forms-of-fissuring">Secondary Boycott Law and Specific Forms of Fissuring</h2>
<p>Having introduced the secondary boycott doctrine in pertinent part, we turn to the question of how it has been applied to two types of fissuring: Franchising, and subcontracting.</p>
<h3 id="franchising-often-prevents-meaningful-collective-bargaining-between-employees-and-their-franchisee-employers">Franchising Often Prevents Meaningful Collective Bargaining Between Employees and their Franchisee Employers.</h3>
<p>Franchising is a major pillar of the fissured economy. A report commissioned by the International Franchise Association estimates that in 2019, nearly 8.5 million workers in the U.S. were employed by franchised businesses.<sup id="fnref:48"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:48">48</a></sup> Nearly half of them worked in fast food,<sup id="fnref:49"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:49">49</a></sup> a sector whose growth was expected to outpace the overall economy in 2020.<sup id="fnref:50"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:50">50</a></sup> But with this growth comes an ever-greater number of workers who will be subject to harsh restrictions on wages and working conditions, for which they have little recourse. This problem is endemic to franchising for at least two reasons.<sup id="fnref:51"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:51">51</a></sup></p>
<p>First, wages and benefits are constrained by franchisees' low operating margins. Data on franchisee revenues is scarce because most franchisees are privately held companies, but larger, publicly-traded franchisees are a source of some insights, however skewed. For instance, David Weil compared the 2007-08 returns on revenues for Yum! Brands and Burger King with those of their largest franchisees.<sup id="fnref:52"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:52">52</a></sup> While the franchisor returns varied between 11 and 20%, the franchisees' were persistently much lower, ranging from 1 to 7%.<sup id="fnref:53"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:53">53</a></sup> Given that these data necessarily come from the franchisees that own the most locations, economies of scale would suggest that the typical franchisee's returns are even lower.<sup id="fnref:54"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:54">54</a></sup> In this context, employees may be unable to effectively press their employer for meaningfully higher wages.<sup id="fnref:55"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:55">55</a></sup> Moreover, franchisees generally must pay around six percent of their revenues to their franchisor as royalties.<sup id="fnref:56"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:56">56</a></sup> If a franchisee pays its franchisor a greater share of revenues than it takes home, anyone asking for higher wages may be told to "take it up with corporate." If workers are prohibited from doing so, the conversation may end there.</p>
<p>The second factor that prevents meaningful bargaining in the franchise sector is more direct: Franchisors tightly control many aspects of a franchisee's business. This is inherent to a business model that depends on brand reputation; franchisors have strong incentives to ensure that franchisees comply with uniform standards.<sup id="fnref:57"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:57">57</a></sup> These standards often expressly govern a wide variety of working conditions including hiring,<sup id="fnref:58"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:58">58</a></sup> hours,<sup id="fnref:59"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:59">59</a></sup> and discipline policies, among others. Workers are thus unable to negotiate for changes in these areas, except perhaps by inducing their employer to break the franchise agreement and seriously jeopardize the entire workplace.<sup id="fnref:60"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:60">60</a></sup></p>
<p>Apart from these direct controls over conditions, it is also said that franchisors control employees' wages by controlling every variable <em>except wages.</em><sup id="fnref:61"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:61">61</a></sup> In this view, wages are fixed by the dual constraints of expenses and revenues, both of which are determined in large part by the franchise agreement. Expenses are governed by requirements that franchisees buy from specific suppliers, offer particular menu items or services, stay open long hours, or engage in other potentially-costly practices. Meanwhile, revenues are affected by restrictions on the prices franchisees can charge, as well as other factors in the franchisor's control, such as advertising campaigns and the presence of competing franchisees in the area.</p>
<p>This view finds empirical support in Brian Callaci's study of the 2015 Franchise Disclosure Documents for all franchisors with over 80 locations nationwide.<sup id="fnref:62"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:62">62</a></sup> Restrictions like those described above were prevalent. 91% of franchise agreements barred franchisees from selling unapproved products, 64% set mandatory hours of operation, 55% contained no-poaching agreements, and 44% set maximum or minimum prices.<sup id="fnref:63"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:63">63</a></sup> And for the average franchisor, 47% of franchisee's ongoing purchases came from supply sources restricted by the franchisor.<sup id="fnref:64"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:64">64</a></sup> Moreover, the use of these vertical restraints was significantly more common in industries with low wages, high turnover, and inexperienced workers.<sup id="fnref:65"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:65">65</a></sup> Callaci argues that in such industries, franchisors deliberately draft restrictive agreements to steer franchisees toward a labor strategy that relies on tight monitoring and control to extract effort from workers, rather than paying higher wages.<sup id="fnref:66"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:66">66</a></sup></p>
<p>McDonald's is a helpful example for understanding the impacts of these restraints. In 2014, employees at McDonald's franchisees filed multiple class action lawsuits alleging that McDonald's is responsible for wage theft at its franchised locations.<sup id="fnref:67"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:67">67</a></sup> Much of the alleged control is exerted through computer systems provided by McDonald's that track sales, inventory, and labor costs, among other data, and calculate how many people the franchisee must hire, as well as set individual employees' work schedules.<sup id="fnref:68"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:68">68</a></sup> The software tracks the ratio of labor costs to revenues, and when that ratio exceeds a corporate-set target, managers take corrective action to lower it.<sup id="fnref:69"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:69">69</a></sup> McDonald's is also heavily involved in the hiring process, insofar as it maintains websites that allow workers to apply for employment at franchised stores, and such websites allegedly assign each candidate a score before forwarding their application to the franchisee.<sup id="fnref:70"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:70">70</a></sup></p>
<p>While McDonald's may be on the cutting edge of controlling franchised labor, it is far from unique. Franchised businesses in general, and fast food franchisees in particular, face budget and contractual constraints that combine to make meaningful worker bargaining impossible. An independent business facing workers' demands may be able to fund better wages and benefits by raising prices, finding cheaper suppliers for raw materials, or taking any number of other steps. But franchisees are often contractually prohibited from doing so, and when they are not, they nevertheless face strong pressures to conform to the franchisor's policy. If worker bargaining cannot extend beyond the direct employment relationship, its scope is necessarily extremely limited.</p>
<h3 id="but-secondary-boycott-doctrine-has-not-allowed-unions-to-picket-franchisors">But Secondary Boycott Doctrine Has Not Allowed Unions to Picket Franchisors</h3>
<p>Franchisors' influence on the employment conditions of franchisees' employees highlights the need for workers to be permitted to exert pressure on such franchisors. However, only a few secondary boycott cases have addressed the issue.</p>
<p>The Board's current position may perhaps be inferred from Member Miscimarra's arguments against the <em>Browning-Ferris</em> joint employer standard. He states that before <em>Browning-Ferris</em>, "a union with a labor dispute with one franchisee typically could not picket the franchisor and all of its other franchisees."<sup id="fnref:71"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:71">71</a></sup> No authority is cited for this statement. However, dissenting in <em>McDonald's USA, LLC</em>, Miscimarra similarly claims that the secondary boycott provision "protects neutral employers, including franchisees, from being embroiled in a dispute just because they do business with a common franchisor."<sup id="fnref:72"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:72">72</a></sup> For this, he cites <em>Carvel Corp.</em>.<sup id="fnref:73"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:73">73</a></sup></p>
<p>In that case, franchisees licensed the franchisor's name to sell ice cream created by third-party dairies using the franchisor's recipe.<sup id="fnref:74"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:74">74</a></sup> The franchisor signed leases for each franchise's premises then assigned those leases to the franchisees, who paid rent to the property owner, not the franchisor.<sup id="fnref:75"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:75">75</a></sup> Franchisees were required to source most ingredients and equipment from the franchisor or approved sources, sell only the franchisor's products, and pay the franchisor a fixed royalty fee per gallon of ice cream, plus advertising fees.<sup id="fnref:76"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:76">76</a></sup> The agreement set required hours of operation, but in practice franchisees could determine their own hours.<sup id="fnref:77"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:77">77</a></sup> While they could sell only the franchisor's products, they could sell any selection of those products, and were perfectly free to depart from the suggested retail prices.<sup id="fnref:78"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:78">78</a></sup></p>
<p>The union in <em>Carvel Corp.</em> had a primary dispute with the franchisor, and when it picketed several franchisees, the Southern ​District of New York granted a preliminary injunction after considering the franchise's ally status.<sup id="fnref:79"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:79">79</a></sup> After balancing the franchise's total economic interdependence against the franchisor's very limited involvement in day-to-day operations, the court found it "far from clear" whether they were allies.<sup id="fnref:80"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:80">80</a></sup> Ultimately the deciding factor was the fact that the union was picketing <em>individual</em> franchisees, which would necessarily hurt them much more than the primary employer, the franchisor.<sup id="fnref:81"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:81">81</a></sup></p>
<p>However, in a typical fissured employment case, where the primary dispute is with a <em>franchisee</em>, the court's reasoning here would seem to imply that a union could indeed picket the franchisor. However, for the Board upholding the injunction, the case was not as close. While the Board agreed that there was a strong integration of operations and economic interdependency, the Court found those factors insufficient in the absence of common ownership or managerial control, and in light of the franchisees' total control over labor relations.<sup id="fnref:82"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:82">82</a></sup> Still, the franchise agreement in this case was in many respects less stringent than those that govern many workplaces today, like the fast food franchise agreements discussed above, which often dictate in much more detail the franchisees' menus and prices, and much more closely monitor labor relations. Given that difference, <em>Carvel Corp.</em> hardly establishes franchisors' neutrality as a general rule.</p>
<p>Another rare holding on the neutrality of franchisors comes from the now-famous <em>Jimmy John's</em> case. There, employees of a Jimmy John's franchisee who owned ten locations published posters indicating that Jimmy John's policy against sick days was endangering consumers.<sup id="fnref:83"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:83">83</a></sup> Most of the analysis and issues on appeal concerned the posters' alleged disloyalty, but the administrative law judge also rejected a secondary boycott allegation. After finding that the activity was protected as handbilling without picketing, the administrative law judge added that "the fact that employees were required to sign <em>Jimmy John's rules for employment</em> is sufficient to dispose of [the argument] that Jimmy John's is a neutral employer in this matter."<sup id="fnref:84"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:84">84</a></sup> This is significant because, while the "Rules of Employment" bore Jimmy John's logo, there was no showing that franchisees had a standard sick leave policy.<sup id="fnref:85"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:85">85</a></sup> However, Jimmy John's did <em>suggest</em> the policy to the franchisee.<sup id="fnref:86"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:86">86</a></sup> This would seem to mean that, at least where a policy expressly recommended by the franchisor is at issue in a labor dispute, the franchisor is not considered neutral. Given the force and prevalence of these kinds of "suggestions" by franchisors,<sup id="fnref:87"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:87">87</a></sup> a rule of this sort would likely defeat franchisors' neutrality in a wide range of situations.<sup id="fnref:88"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:88">88</a></sup></p>
<p>Besides <em>Carvel</em> and <em>Jimmy John's</em>, few cases have addressed the ally status of franchises in the secondary boycott context.<sup id="fnref:89"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:89">89</a></sup> However, because the ally doctrine typically relies on the same four factors---interrelation of operations, common management, common or centralized control of labor relations, and common ownership or financial control---used to determine single employer status in other contexts, it is helpful to review the application of these factors to franchisors more generally, outside the secondary boycott context. As a general matter, various Board decisions have suggested that the fact that franchisees largely purchase their stock from the franchisor's suppliers is not sufficient to render them functionally integrated with the employer.<sup id="fnref:90"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:90">90</a></sup> On the other hand, where two entities hold themselves out to the public as a single integrated business enterprise, as franchises generally do, this fact does weigh in favor of interrelation of operations.<sup id="fnref:91"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:91">91</a></sup> For analysis beyond these general principles, it is helpful to examine specific cases.</p>
<p>In 1962 in <em>Elias Bros. Big Boy, Inc.</em>, the Board considered the single employer status of a restaurant franchisor and franchisee to determine whether to combine their revenues for jurisdictional purposes.<sup id="fnref:92"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:92">92</a></sup> The franchise agreement was much like the highly-restrictive fast-food franchises discussed in the previous section: The franchisee was required to purchase all goods from the franchisor or approved parties, sell only the franchisor's foods at the franchisor's prices, pay the franchisor a percentage of gross sales, and follow the franchisor's personnel policies "such as, but not limited to, wage standards and uniforms."<sup id="fnref:93"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:93">93</a></sup> The franchisor, in turn, reserved the right to terminate the agreement, and employed a "franchise supervisor" who rated employees' but only communicated with management.<sup id="fnref:94"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:94">94</a></sup></p>
<p>The Board found that the "sweeping terms" of the agreement gave the franchisor "some control over the labor policy of [a franchisee] and made for integration of operations," and the franchisor's "broad latitude" to terminate the agreement gave it "a strong lever to induce conformity."<sup id="fnref:95"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:95">95</a></sup> Nevertheless, the Board speculated that the franchisee could still operate its restaurant if the franchise agreement were terminated, so its dependence was not as severe as that of gasoline distributors, who were <em>still</em> sometimes held not to be single employers.<sup id="fnref:96"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:96">96</a></sup> Apparently because of these weaker facts, the Board noted that the General Counsel had to rely largely on the franchise agreement, which the Board had previously held could not be relied on for establishing jurisdiction.<sup id="fnref:97"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:97">97</a></sup> Therefore, it held that they were not a single employer.</p>
<p>If the <em>Big Boy</em> Board's analysis were turned to a secondary boycott case, that jurisdictional rule would not apply. And in the context of a modern restaurant franchise, it is much more difficult to say that a franchisee could operate independently if the relationship were terminated.<sup id="fnref:98"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:98">98</a></sup> At the same time, however, most franchisors have probably become too cautious to include contract terms expressly reserving control over wages like the one in <em>Big Boy</em>. At the very least, the case suggests that a particularly-strict franchise agreement and the threat of unilateral contract termination both point towards single employer status, however weakly.</p>
<p>In sum, the ability of workers in fissured franchising to picket franchisors is far from clear. The current Board has suggested that picketing in such cases would not be allowed, but the underlying case law is a mix. While the Board has not often found single employer status in the past, these cases generally have not addressed agreements as strict as the likes of McDonald's. Meanwhile, any assertion of <em>joint employer</em> status as an alternative defense is likely to fail in light of the Board's new rule on the matter. Thus, for the time being, the ambiguities of the secondary boycott law will likely continue to deter effective worker organizing against franchisors.</p>
<h3 id="subcontracted-work-in-general-prevents-meaningful-bargaining">Subcontracted Work in General Prevents Meaningful Bargaining</h3>
<p>Franchising is only one of many business models that place intermediaries between workers and those who profit from their labor, insulating them from organizing efforts. In many workplaces, firms have turned away from employment by looking to outside contractors to fulfill more and more of their key functions.<sup id="fnref:99"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:99">99</a></sup> This is related to the more visible issue of classifying individual workers as independent contractors, but more complex. Often, the practice produces multiple layers of subcontractors, each competing to be the lowest bidder for the layer above. Weil argues that this setup reflects the interests of lead firms---the ultimate purchasers of labor, who structure subcontracting arrangements to align contractors' interests in their favor.<sup id="fnref:100"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:100">100</a></sup></p>
<p>A striking example of this phenomenon exists in the warehousing and logistics industry responsible for transporting products between the many steps in the modern supply chain---from manufacture to retail. Companies typically contract third-party logistics (3PL) firms to handle this labor.<sup id="fnref:101"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:101">101</a></sup> These firms, in turn, contract with staffing firms and motor carriers, which then employ (or misclassify) the workers who load and unload goods and drive them between ports, warehouses, and retailers.<sup id="fnref:102"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:102">102</a></sup> Intense competition between staffing firms and motor carriers leads to decreased wages and frequent violations of wage and hour laws and other workplace protections.<sup id="fnref:103"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:103">103</a></sup></p>
<p>While wages are driven down by competition at each layer, the conditions of work tend to be tightly constrained from the top. For example, in the coal mining industry, a prominent business strategy is for the leading company to negotiate coal prices with the local utility company and subcontract out the mining work subject to strict quality standards, while retaining control of the mine, the equipment, and the location of delivery.<sup id="fnref:104"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:104">104</a></sup> Likewise, the healthcare industry is heavily-subcontracted, but various regulations like Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules, as well as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, give hospitals strong reasons to exert indirect control over their subcontractors' employees.<sup id="fnref:105"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:105">105</a></sup> And in janitorial work, it is often the top-level janitorial contractor, not the direct employer several layers down, that negotiates jobs with the building manager.<sup id="fnref:106"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:106">106</a></sup> In all of these cases, subcontracting has created situations where workers are bound by terms imposed by companies other than their direct employer.</p>
<p>However, even where the terms of work are not formally directed by lead firms whatsoever, the intense competition between contractors seeking to serve them ensures that the contractors that survive are those that conform to the lead firm's expectations.<sup id="fnref:107"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:107">107</a></sup> While such dynamics are not easily described by existing labor law, they are no less capable of governing labor relations.</p>
<p>This subcontracting has had serious impacts on the quality of jobs. A study of in-house versus outsourced janitors and security guards between 1983 and 2000 found that outsourcing was associated with lower wages, fewer benefits, and lower rates of unionization.<sup id="fnref:108"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:108">108</a></sup> Furthermore, the study also found that much of the wage difference lay in the upper half of wages,<sup id="fnref:109"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:109">109</a></sup> and, crucially, that among outsourced workers, unionization was associated with a smaller premium than among in-house workers.<sup id="fnref:110"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:110">110</a></sup> These latter findings on the compression of wages are consistent with the idea that fissuring serves to limit the scope of what unions may demand.</p>
<h3 id="yet-even-when-contractors-are-completely-dominated-the-board-punishes-their-workers-for-bargaining-with-the-lead-firms">Yet Even When Contractors Are Completely Dominated, the Board Punishes Their Workers for Bargaining with the Lead Firms</h3>
<p>One would hope that the ally doctrine could account for fissured contracting, since its founding case arguably arose out of such a relationship. In <em>Douds v. Metropolitan Federation of Architects</em>, the primary employer entered a cost-plus agreement with the allegedly-neutral contractor wherein it "bought" the services of the contractor's employees, directed and supervised them, and set their maximum wages.<sup id="fnref:111"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:111">111</a></sup> While the contract expressly provided that the contractor's employees remained its own, the court found it more significant that the contract <em>needed</em> this provision.<sup id="fnref:112"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:112">112</a></sup> Moreover, though these terms were said to be common in the industry, the court found this only meant "the practices in a particular industry may be such that the normal contractor-subcontractor relationship carries with it the label of "ally.""<sup id="fnref:113"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:113">113</a></sup></p>
<p>Measured against this prescient language, later developments in the ally doctrine have been less sensitive to the realities of contract labor. To begin with, much of the problem of fissuring comes not from any direct control actively exercised by lead firms, but rather from the fact that competitive subcontracting pushes wages down. But this does not fit neatly into any of the ally doctrine's major frameworks, and the Board has flatly rejected arguments that tight-margin contracts of that sort create ally status.<sup id="fnref:114"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:114">114</a></sup> And despite <em>Douds</em>' suggestion that compliance with industry norms should be irrelevant to determining ally status, the Board seems to have often decided cases by reference to such norms.<sup id="fnref:115"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:115">115</a></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps most disturbingly, the Board has allowed the purchasers of contract labor to remain "neutral" even when they personally work to defeat union organizing among their contractors. This ugly principle was revealed during the Justice for Janitors campaign by Service Employees International Union. The campaign's overall strategy was to induce commercial building managers to hire unionized janitorial contractors, rather than non-unionized. Unsurprisingly, this campaign spawned a number of secondary boycott cases.<sup id="fnref:116"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:116">116</a></sup></p>
<p>In one such case, <em>The Lenkin Company</em>, the neutral property management company, along with the janitorial contractor, were parties to the same trade association.<sup id="fnref:117"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:117">117</a></sup> The property manager's president was on the association's board of directors which voted unanimously to lead and coordinate the industry's efforts to combat the Justice for Janitors campaign.<sup id="fnref:118"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:118">118</a></sup> The property manager's president led the fundraising for this effort, whose express purpose was to "fight the union on all levels," and the property management company itself regularly contributed to the fund.<sup id="fnref:119"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:119">119</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Board found that the company did not lose its neutral status. Rather, the Board asserted that neutrals need not "be totally disengaged from a labor dispute to retain their neutrality."<sup id="fnref:120"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:120">120</a></sup> It went on to legitimize the partisanship of neutrals, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, a customer may want a supplier to resist union demands for a substantial wage increase. The customer may be concerned that such a wage increase will result in a price increase to the customer. Thus, the customer is not "wholly unconcerned" as to the supplier-union bargaining dispute. But, that does not permit the union to picket the customer.<sup id="fnref:121"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:121">121</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, it was an unfair labor practice for the union to exert pressure on an entity that was arguably more involved in the labor dispute than the primary employer was.</p>
<p>At least one Justice for Janitors case found the union's activity to be primary, but it is not representative. In that case, the janitorial contractor, a sole proprietor who employed the workers, was found to <em>himself</em> be an employee of the property manager, in light of the property manager's very frequent and specific directions, and her unilateral drafting of a contract, which referred to his "salary."<sup id="fnref:122"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:122">122</a></sup> In a more typical case, the involvement of a larger janitorial contractor or a savvier property manager would likely have prevented this outcome, with little difference in the substantive relationship.</p>
<p>In sum, and as <em>The Lenkin Company</em> demonstrates above all else, the purchasers of contract labor can influence working conditions by methods that are completely outside the view of the modern ally doctrine. Consequently, workers are often unable to oppose such influence without their conduct being branded secondary, and likely illegal.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The secondary boycott law was designed to protect "wholly unconcerned" parties from labor disputes. But as companies have disintegrated into vast networks of franchisees, subcontractors, and other intermediaries, they have remained equally dependent on labor. At the end of the day, they retain the incentive to extract the most work for the lowest price. And by contract, monopsony, and trade associations they have powerful tools to achieve this goal. It has become impossible to credibly call such firms "wholly unconcerned" with the labor disputes that occur beneath their watchful eye.</p>
<p>If the law has responded to this reality, the response has only been to ratify it. "Neutrality" has expanded to include active combatants. While not every decision has been so extreme as <em>The Lenkin Company</em>, the ally doctrine's persistent vagueness has given labor organizations strong reasons to be extremely cautious exerting pressure on anyone but direct employers.</p>
<p>But in many of the industries with the most vulnerable workers, direct employers will go out of business and be immediately replaced, if their labor costs are raised a cent above what their larger clients are willing to pay. By ensuring that workers deal only with the lowest level of the supply chain, the secondary boycott law narrows the scope of acceptable bargaining to near-zero.</p>

<p>This analytical division between different terms and conditions might itself make joint employer status more elusive. For example, when a commentator argues that franchisors that impose no-poaching agreements should be considered joint employers, the Board responds by finding that the practice has too attenuated an impact on <em>wages</em> to be considered. <em>Id.</em> at 11218.

<p>This is not to suggest that franchisees' employees are struggling only for raises. A preliminary request might be for a modest decline in wage theft. A study of Fair Labor Standards Act investigations from 2001-2005 found that among the top-20 branded fast food restaurants, franchisees were substantially more likely to violate minimum wage and overtime laws than were comparable company-owned locations. Minwoong Ji &amp; David Weil, <em>The Impact of Franchising on Labor Standards Compliance</em>, 68 ILR Rev.: J. Work &amp; Pol'y 977 (2015). While franchisors' greater incentives for labor law compliance may explain some of this gap, franchisees' budget constraints probably also contribute.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:55" title="Jump back to footnote 55 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>One such hiring restriction that has received substantial attention is the use of "no-poaching" clauses that bar franchisees from hiring workers from other franchisees in the same chain, sometimes even for a period of time after their employment ends. <em>See</em> Alan B. Krueger &amp; Orley Ashenfelter, <em>Theory and Evidence on Employer Collusion in the Franchise Sector</em> (Nat'l Bureau of Econ. Res., Working Paper No. 24831, 2018) (finding 58% of franchisors used such clauses, which were associated with low-wage and high-turnover industries); <em>see also</em> Callaci, <em>infra</em> notes 62-66 and accompanying text. Ironically, when these clauses are challenged on antitrust grounds, they are often defended on the basis that the franchisor and franchisee constitute a single enterprise and are thus unable to collude in restraint of trade. Catherine E. Schaefer, <em>Disagreeing Over Agreements: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of No-Poaching Agreements in the Franchise Sector</em>, 87 Fordham L. Rev. 2285, 2293-96 (2019). Of course, in the secondary boycott context this argument is anathema to such franchisors.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:58" title="Jump back to footnote 58 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>For a sense of how damaging it is to lose franchise status, consider this: In a rare case where a McDonald's franchisee terminated the franchise relationship yet continued to operate in similar fashion, sales fell immediately by sixty percent and did not recover.

<p>Still, while the ruling was upheld by the Board and this finding was never disturbed on appeal, it is only a tangential issue in the case. Moreover, in light of the less-controversial finding that the activity was not coercive picketing even if it <em>were</em> secondary, the denial of neutral status is arguably dicta.

<p>There are a few franchise secondary boycott cases that do not directly bear on the more general question of franchisor neutrality. In one, the Board found a secondary boycott when the union picketed a franchisor-manufacturer when its dispute was with the franchisee distributors, but the analysis rested largely on the right-of-control test applicable to work-preservation clauses.
