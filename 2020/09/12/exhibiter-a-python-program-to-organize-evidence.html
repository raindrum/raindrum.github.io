<hr>
<p>When I was working at the <a href="https://edn.la/">Eviction Defense Network</a> this past summer, one of my jobs was to put together jury documents---that is, sets of documents that would be shared with opposing counsel and eventually the court in preparation for jury trials.</p>
<p>One aspect of this was to collect all the evidence (various PDFs and images) and put it into a single PDF with cover pages for each exhibit. A related task was to list all the contents in a Word document.</p>
<p>When cases have very large amounts of evidence, and when the list and PDF must be updated upon receiving <em>new</em> evidence, it quickly becomes a hassle to do this manually. So, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/raindrum/exhibiter">a program to automate the process</a>. As long as evidence is arranged in folders and given meaningful names, the program can generate a PDF and exhibit list in seconds.</p>
<p>I hope to make more tools like this in the future. Eviction defense is too important to let its practitioners to get bogged down rearranging documents.</p>
