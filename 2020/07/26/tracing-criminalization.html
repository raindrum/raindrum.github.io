<p>Maggie Gaffney, Michelle Zhang, Ilan Zur and I wrote this report for a class in the Fall 2019 semester at UCLA Law. Many thanks to Victor Narro and Ana Luz Gonzalez of the UCLA Labor Center, who provided invaluable assistance.</p>
<p>As part of the report we used an online tool called <a href="https://awesome-table.com/">Awesome Table</a> to make it easy to explore trends in several large datasets on local policing and prosecution. You can explore the data yourself at the following links, but note that they take a long time to load, and might fail if you open more than one at once.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The criminalization of low-level offenses is a significant issue in Los Angeles. The policing and prosecution of such low-level offenses and quality of life crimes by means of citations, fines, and jail-time, not only harms already vulnerable community members by exacerbating existing financial, medical, employment, and housing struggles but represents an overall drain on municipal resources by perpetuating vicious cycles of poverty and imprisonment. This report, relying on qualitative and quantitative data regarding misdemeanor and infraction charges collected from Court Watch Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Police Department, and the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office, aims to shed light on both general and specific trends in low-level offense criminalization, discrepancies in the types of offenses that are enforced, and the impact that such criminalization efforts have on vulnerable communities. We hope that this report can assist in generating compelling and data-based policy recommendations to be used in existing and subsequent advocacy efforts to eliminate quality of life crimes in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>It is possible that the report contains minor misclassifications that affect how arrests were categorized by charge. While the report is broadly accurate, if you rely on information about a specific topic (e.g. homelessness-related arrests), we encourage you to first verify it by reference to the methodology section and appendices.</p>
<h2 id="2-methodology">2. Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="courtwatch-data">CourtWatch Data</h3>
<p>In 2019, the National Lawyers Guild of Los Angeles and the ACLU of SoCal collaborated to create a Court Watch program in Los Angeles. The program recruited volunteers to attend court in downtown Los Angeles and observe criminal court cases. The court watch program has gone through multiple iterations of a form for volunteers to record their observations in. Some forms were in physical form, which have to be inputted electronically. In addition, a Google form was used for a period of time. The purpose of the court watch program is to shed light on the ways in which low-level offenses are criminalized in Los Angeles. Recently, Ana Luz Gonzalez-Vasquez, a Project Manager at the UCLA Labor Center, provided consultation with the project in order to revamp the court watch program’s data gathering form for volunteers to use. Concerning next steps for the Court Watch program, we recommend further streamlining the form and training volunteers on data entry into the form.</p>
<h3 id="interviews">Interviews</h3>
<p>A component of our research involved interviewing local public defenders, a suggestion we received from Kath Rogers from NLG and Adrienna Wong from the ACLU, after we first spoke about the project in general. Ilan and Maggie spoke with Drew Haven and Michelle and Simon spoke with Rosemary McClure, both from the Los Angeles Public Defender’s Office. The interview provided an opportunity to ask specifically what issues these two practitioners had observed related to the criminalization of homelessness. Both provided a helpful contextual foundation to start thinking about the issues surrounding the issue prior to receiving any LAPD or City Attorney data. Once the quantitative data arrived, the contextual framework from the interviews provided qualitative data to support our findings. </p>
<h3 id="lapd-and-city-attorney-data">LAPD and City Attorney Data</h3>
<p>Much of our research rests on two sets of data provided to us by law enforcement bodies. The first dataset was provided by the Los Angeles Police Department in response to a request by Professor Victor Narro of the UCLA Labor Center. It contains demographic and other information about 103,560 misdemeanor and infraction citations the LAPD issued between October 31, 2017 and October 30, 2019.</p>
<p>The second dataset was provided by the Los Angeles City Attorney’s office in response to a California Public Records Act request mailed by the American Civil Liberties Union on August 28, 2019. It contains similar demographic information, as well as charging decisions and case outcomes. This dataset covers 166,429 misdemeanor and infraction cases </p>
<h4 id="coding-the-data">Coding the Data</h4>
<p>In order to analyze trends among different types of crimes, it was necessary to categorize the myriad charges found in the data. Broadly speaking, this was a two-step process: First, we defined the codes that we would be using, and second, we coded both datasets by assigning each distinct charge a code.</p>
<h5 id="defining-the-codes">Defining the Codes</h5>
<p>To categorize the types of charges, we first needed a set of categories. For a basic framework, we started with the categories used in the recent report, <em>Trends in Misdemeanor Arrests in Los Angeles: 2001-2017</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> This was chosen as a base because of the study’s shared focus on low-level offenses in Los Angeles. We believed that because of this similarity, it would fit the data set well. Nevertheless, we decided to disaggregate many of these codes to better fit the project’s focus on decriminalization. In particular, we were interested in charges associated with the criminalization of homelessness, sex work, and drugs.</p>
<p>The National Coalition for the Homeless defines the criminalization of homelessness as “measures that prohibit life-sustaining activities such as sleeping/camping, eating, sitting, and/or asking for money/resources in public spaces.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> <em>Trends in Misdemeanor Arrests</em> has no category directly associated with homelessness, but it did have a code for “crimes related to loitering, trespassing, and disorderly behaviors.” We replaced this code with a new category, “Homelessness-Related.” In this category, we included nine different codes. Collectively, these codes include laws against sitting and sleeping, loitering, storing personal property on sidewalks, camping in public parks, panhandling, and trespassing.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Trends in Misdemeanor Arrests</em> has codes that correspond to prostitution, alcohol, and drug laws, but in the interest of improving granularity, we split each of these codes into categories, and defined sub-codes. The “Prostitution” category is meant broadly to include charges related to sex work, and it disaggregates prostitution, loitering with intent of prostitution, unlicensed escort work, solicitation, and supervising prostitution. The latter is split off specifically to allow a basic distinction between policing of sex trafficking and policing of sex workers.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The “Drugs” category includes codes corresponding to consumption, possession, and transactions. The “Alcohol-Related” category includes open container laws, public intoxication, and laws related to underage drinking. Finally, there were also several categories in <em>Trends in Misdemeanor Arrests</em> that we expanded and tweaked. The “Crimes Against Persons” category now distinguishes between domestic violence, sexual battery, and other kinds of battery. The “Property/Theft-Related” category was given codes for shoplifting and vandalism. And the “Vehicle-Related” category was given a code for driving with a suspended license or other license issues.</p>
<p>In total, we defined 47 codes across 10 categories: Crimes Against Persons, Property/Theft-Related, Vehicle/Driving-Related, Weapon Charges, Drugs, Prostitution, Alcohol-Related, Failure to Appear/Contempt, Homelessness-Related, and Other. The full table of codes is attached as Appendix A.</p>
<h5 id="assigning-codes-to-the-data">Assigning Codes to the Data</h5>
<p>Once we had a set of codes, it was time to apply the codes to the datasets. Our goal was to assign codes to all or nearly all cases in each dataset. This was complicated by the sheer size of both datasets, as well as the fact that the same substantive charge was written in many subtly-different ways in each dataset. For instance, the LAPD data had arrests for “41.18DLAMC”, “4118D”, “41.18(D)LAMC,” and other similar permutations.</p>
<p>We opted to code these varied charges directly, rather than take a separate step to clean them into uniform charge names. In retrospect, this may have been a mistake, because now the charges cannot easily be recategorized. In any case, we followed the same process for each dataset:</p>
<p>First, each dataset included a column representing the arrest charge. We copied this column to a new sheet, and removed all duplicate rows. In the LAPD data, this left us with 2,886 unique charges. We decided that this was too many charges for us to code, so we decided to code only a subset of the charges.</p>
<p>To avoid introducing bias in the data, we needed a content-neutral way to choose which cases to code. We also wanted to code as many cases as possible with as little effort as possible. Based on these considerations, we decided to code charges based on the number of times they appear in the dataset. Specifically, we decided to set a threshold number, and only code the charges that appeared at least that many times. The drawback of this strategy is that we did not code either (a) exceptionally rare charges, or (b) common charges that were written in very unique ways.</p>
<p>To set an appropriate cutoff point for the LAPD data, we needed to find the smallest set of charges that covered the largest fraction of the dataset. To do this, we used a spreadsheet function<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> to count the number of times each unique charge appeared in the dataset. We then sorted the new sheet by this count, so that the most frequent charges appeared at the top. We then added a column filled with a spreadsheet function<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> that tallied the number of arrests associated with the unique charges on or above a given row. By comparing this column with the column that counted each charge’s number of occurrences, we determined that we could cover 97.4% of the LAPD dataset by coding only the charges that appeared five times or more. This meant coding only 725 of the distinct charges, rather than the full 2,886. We decided that five occurrences per point would be an appropriate cutoff point for the LAPD data.</p>
<p>We followed the same process to set a cutoff point for the City Attorney dataset. Of the 166,429 cases, there were 1,158 distinct charges. We determined that by coding the 591 distinct charges with five or more occurrences, we would cover 99.77% of the data.</p>
<p>Once we defined these sets of charges to code, we divided up the charges among ourselves and coded them according to the code sheet in Appendix A. For each charge, we chose a code based on the text of the statute to which the charge refers. For instance, the text of <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/los_angeles/latest/lamc/0-0-0-128669">LAMC 41.27</a>(c) expressly refers to the act of drinking alcohol in public, so it is coded under Code 26: Drinking Alcohol. </p>
<p>For many of the charges, particularly in the LAPD data, the same charge was written in numerous different ways. <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/los_angeles/latest/lamc/0-0-0-128514">LAMC 41.18</a>(d), for example, was written variously as "41.18DLAMC," "41.18(D)LAMC," and "4118D," among others. When we coded the LAPD dataset, all charges were sorted in order from most common to least common. Unfortunately, this meant that the different permutations of each charge were far apart, and were coded by different people at different times. This increased the difficulty of the coding process, and may have impacted its consistency. We mitigated this issue somewhat in coding the City Attorney dataset, by sorting the charges alphabetically so that most charge permutations were adjacent to one another. In retrospect, it would have been better to manually convert all charge names to a standardized format before coding them. While there may be inconsistencies in the coding of certain charges, we are more confident in the coding at the overall category level. In any case, the accuracy or inaccuracy of a given code can be verified by looking at its included charges in Appendix A.</p>
<h4 id="geocoding-the-data">Geocoding the Data</h4>
<p>We geocoded both the LAPD data and the City Attorney data using the LA County CAMS Address Locator<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> in ArcGIS. For input, this geocoder takes a spreadsheet that needs the following columns: street address, city, and state. Neither dataset had exactly these columns, and both datasets contained many duplicate addresses that would be wasteful to geocode twice. So, the data required processing.</p>
<p>Addresses in the original LAPD data were split across columns M through S, storing each address component (e.g. street number versus street name) separately. Many rows contained no street number, but in such cases they listed a cross-street in rows Q through S. We concatenated all address data into one column, and inserted the word “and” before any cross-streets, using a spreadsheet function.<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> We then copied the results column to a new file, in a sheet titled “LAPD Addresses.”</p>
<p>Next we processed the City Attorney data similarly. Here the street address and cross street were only split across columns Q and R. However, in each column, some values were either blank or “NULL.” We concatenated these with another spreadsheet function<sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> to put the addresses in the same format as the processed LAPD data. Next we copied the results column to a new sheet, titled “City Attorney Addresses,” in the same file as the processed LAPD data. Again we used Google Sheets’ “Remove Duplicates” function on this sheet so they would appear only once.</p>
<p>To avoid having to run the geocoder more than once, we created a third sheet, “Combined Addresses,” and copied both sets of addresses to the same column in this sheet. To account for addresses that might be present in both sheets, we again ran the “Remove Duplicates” function. To avoid losing potentially important information by combining the sets of addresses, we created a second column, to list whether each address was present in the LAPD data, the City Attorney data, or both. This column was filled via another spreadsheet function.<sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>The geocoder would require not only street addresses but a column each for the city and state. We manually added those columns, filling them entirely with “Los Angeles” and “California” respectively. It is possible that this step caused some geocoding errors if either the LAPD or prosecutors were operating outside of the city. However, this risk is mitigated by the fact that the CAMS Locator is designed to account for “the fuzzy concept of cities.”<sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the addresses were ready to geocode. We downloaded the “Combined Addresses” sheet as a CSV file, and opened ArcGIS. In ArcGIS, we navigated to File&gt;Add Data&gt;Geocoding&gt;Geocode Addresses. In that menu, we selected the CAMS Address Locator. We relied on the CAMS Locator’s default settings, with one exception: To ensure the geocoded coordinates would be compatible with Google’s Awesome Table, we changed the spatial reference system in Advanced Geometry Options to GCS_WGS_1984, which we had read was compatible with Google Maps.<sup id="fnref:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>The geocoder works by setting a required threshold of similarity between the given address and an address in the county’s database of street locations. For each address, the geocoder outputs either “M” for match, if the most similar address meets this threshold; “U” for unmatched, if there is no address that meets the threshold; or “T” for tie if multiple addresses are equally similar but both meet the threshold. By default, the geocoder assigns one of the tied addresses, presumably randomly. Thus, both “M” and “T” results are assigned a geocoded address and coordinates.</p>
<p>Of the 119,482 addresses, 86464 (72%) returned M, 8,813 (7%) returned T, and 24,205 (20%) returned U. After looking at a selection of the results marked T, we decided to include these addresses in the dataset because the alternative addresses appeared to be identical in most cases, likely because the CAMS database contains duplicate addresses. However, it is possible that this introduced significant errors for some addresses. For instance, an address that was in the original data as “1 Example St” might be coded improperly as “1 North Example St” when it should be “1 <em>South</em> Example St.”</p>
<p>After the geocoding was complete, it was necessary to export the geocoded layer as a spreadsheet so it could be viewed in Awesome Table and other software. First, we used ArcGIS’s “Add XY Coordinates” function to add each address’s coordinates, in Gcs_WGS_1984 format, to the attributes table of the geocoded layer. Next, we exported the data to a spreadsheet by opening the layer’s attribute table and selecting “Export.” This produced a DBF file which was then opened in a spreadsheet program and converted to XLSX format.</p>
<p>After that, it was time to apply the geocoded coordinates to the LAPD and City Attorney datasets. For each dataset, we followed this procedure: We opened the file containing the dataset and added a new sheet, titled “Geocodes.” We then copied the POINT_X (longitude) and POINT_Y (latitude) columns from the spreadsheet exported from ArcGIS into this “Geocodes” sheet. Then, in the sheet containing the raw data, we added two new columns: Longitude and Latitude. We used a spreadsheet function<sup id="fnref:13"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13">13</a></sup> to populate these fields by searching for whichever row in “Geocodes” matched the (pre-geocoding) street address in that row of the dataset, and returning the coordinates from that row of the “Geocodes” sheet. Thus, in each dataset, every row was assigned a set of coordinates if the geocoder successfully returned coordinates for that row’s address.</p>
<p>We later verified how many rows were successfully geocoded in the final dataset. The LAPD data included 103,560 arrests. Of those, 78,265 (75.6%) were marked as “M” for match; 10,905 (10.5%) were marked as “T” for tied; and 14,390 (13.8%) were marked “U” for unmatched. As mentioned before, “T” matches still returned apparently-reliable sets of coordinates, so this brought the total number of geocoded arrests to 89,170, or 86.1% of the dataset.</p>
<p>The City Attorney data contained 166,428 cases. Of these, 103,058 (61.9%) were marked “M”; 10,246 (6.1%) were marked “T”; and 53,124 (31.9%) were not matched. The matches and the ties together total 113,304 cases, or 68.1% of the dataset. Several factors explain why the City Attorney data experienced more failures in geocoding than did the LAPD data. First, every LAPD arrest had <em>something</em> in its address fields, whereas a full 12,308 (7.3%) of the City Attorney cases had totally blank addresses, ensuring that they could not be geocoded. Second, even where addresses were not blank, many of the City Attorney cases included only vague locations, like “King.”</p>
<p>All told, 86.1% of the LAPD data and 68.1% of the City Attorney data were successfully geocoded. As discussed above, several steps in the process introduced potential errors whose prevalence cannot easily be evaluated. First, the geocoder was set to operate on the assumption that each street address was in Los Angeles, California. Second, wherever two locations matched an address equally and were above the success threshold, one was assigned arbitrarily. Third, the geocoder itself inevitably introduces some level of error. Still, visual inspection of the geocoded addresses suggests that the vast majority are correct.</p>
<p>After geocoding the data, we used the geocodes to assign each arrest or city attorney case to the city council district where the incident occurred. We did this using QGIS, an open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) tool. We loaded each geocoded dataset as a map layer using QGIS’ “Add Delimited Text Layer” option. Next, we loaded a shapefile containing the boundaries of each city council district.<sup id="fnref:14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14">14</a></sup> For each dataset, we then performed a spatial join using QGIS’ “Join Attributes by Location” tool to assign each point the district number of the city council district whose boundaries it was within. We exported the resulting layers to CSV files, which contained each dataset along with the added district numbers.</p>
<h4 id="processing-the-data-for-awesome-table">Processing the Data for Awesome Table</h4>
<p>To facilitate exploration and analysis of the data, we used a visualization tool called Awesome Table.<sup id="fnref:15"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:15">15</a></sup> This allowed us to view graphs, charts, and maps of each dataset, which could easily be filtered by any criteria present in the data. For instance, Awesome Table let us filter the LAPD data to show a map of nighttime arrests for homelessness-related charges. We could also could view pie charts of City Attorney filing decisions, and look for differences based on the defendant’s race.</p>
<p>We needed to reformat the data, both to make it compatible with Awesome Table at all, and to make the best use of Awesome Table’s features. At its most basic level, Awesome Table requires a spreadsheet in Google Sheets’ native format, with two header rows: one for each column’s title, and one to tell the table how that column should be filtered.<sup id="fnref:16"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16">16</a></sup> Accordingly, we copied each dataset to new spreadsheets on Google Sheets, and inserted a subheader row for filters. We also deleted or renamed various columns in each dataset, and added new columns as described below. We also rearranged columns for clarity.</p>
<h5 id="lapd-data">LAPD Data</h5>
<p>The changes made to this dataset are listed in order from left to right, based on the columns in the original dataset provided by the LAPD. This does not necessarily correspond to the location of each column, if it exists, in the processed data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>RPT_ID</strong>—This column, which contains a unique identifier for each arrest, was left unchanged. It was designated a “StringFilter”<sup id="fnref:17"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17">17</a></sup> to allow searching the data for a specific RPT_ID value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AREA and RPT_DIST</strong>—These columns were deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ARST_DATE</strong>—This column was renamed to “Arrest Date” and was designated a DateFilter to allow Awesome Table to show chronological graphs and filter the data by date ranges. In the original dataset, the date format was YYYYMMDD. For compatibility, this was reformatted to YYYY/MM/DD.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also created a new column based on ARST_DATE, called “Arrest Weekday.” This was populated using an excel function,<sup id="fnref:18"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> then formatted to a cell format that displayed the resulting value (from 1 to 7) as the corresponding day of the week. The resulting weekdays were then verified as correct by comparing several test days to a calendar. This column was designated a CategoryFilter.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ARST_TM</strong>—This column was hidden. While Awesome Table has special filtering options for dates, it has no such options for time of day. To use this value, it was necessary to convert it to serve as either a NumberRangeFilter or a CategoryFilter. The former would allow showing time-based histograms, but it would not be possible to filter by times of day that cross midnight, because this would mean going from twenty-four to zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the importance of viewing nighttime enforcement priorities, we decided to use arrest times as a category filter instead. We created a new column, “Arrest Hour,” to serve as a CategoryFilter. We populated this column using a spreadsheet function<sup id="fnref:19"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:19">19</a></sup> that returned one of twenty-four strings based on what hour-long span contained a given arrest. For instance, an arrest at 1:34PM would be displayed as “13:00 to 14:00.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ARST_CHRG_CD</strong>—This column was renamed “Arrest Charge” and designated a StringFilter.</li>
</ul>
<p>We supplemented this column with a new, hidden column that contained the numerical codes we had assigned to each charge.<sup id="fnref:20"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:20">20</a></sup> Using this column for reference, we added two visible CategoryFilter columns to the dataset. First, we added a “Charge Code” column that we populated using a spreadsheet function<sup id="fnref:21"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:21">21</a></sup> that cross-referenced the code number with a table of the names associated with each code, to return readable code names such as, “15. Possession of Drugs.”</p>
<p>The second visible column we added is “Charge Code Category.” This column was populated using a spreadsheet function<sup id="fnref:22"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:22">22</a></sup> that assigned each arrest a string corresponding to the category that contains its assigned code.<sup id="fnref:23"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:23">23</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ARST_TYP_CD</strong>—This column was renamed “Charge Severity” and designated a CategoryFilter. For each arrest, it contained either “M” or “I.” We used Google Sheets’ find-and-replace function to replace “M” values with “Misdemeanor,” and “I” values with “Infraction.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CHRG_DESC</strong>—This column was renamed “Charge Description” and designated a StringFilter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PRTY_ROLE_CD</strong>—This column was deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SEX_CD, and DESCENT_CD</strong>—These columns were were renamed “Sex” and “Race” respectively, and were designated CategoryFilters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AGE</strong>—This column was renamed “Age,” and was designated a NumberRangeFilter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>STR_NBR, STR_DIR, STR_NM, STR_TYP_CD, CRS_STR_DIR_CD, CRST_STR_NM, and CRS_STR_TYP_CD</strong>—These were combined into a single readable street address using the same formula we used to process the addresses for geocoding.<sup id="fnref:24"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:24">24</a></sup> We named this column “Street Address” and designated it a StringFilter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also added the Longitude and Latitude columns we previously derived from the geocoder.<sup id="fnref:25"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:25">25</a></sup> These were designated as “MapsLong - NoFilter - Hidden” and “MapsLat - NoFilter - Hidden,” respectively, so that Awesome Table’s map feature would recognize them but they would not otherwise appear in the tables.</p>
<p>In addition, we added the “Council District” column that was derived from these coordinates.<sup id="fnref:26"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:26">26</a></sup> This was designated a CategoryFilter.</p>
<h5 id="city-attorney-data">City Attorney Data</h5>
<p>As with the LAPD data, changes are listed in order of the columns in the original dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CityAttyCaseNumber</strong>—This column was renamed “Case Number” and designated a StringFilter.</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>—This column was designated a CategoryFilter.</li>
<li><strong>CaseFilingDecision</strong>—This column was designated a CategoryFilter.</li>
<li><strong>IncidentDate</strong>—This column was renamed “Incident Date,” and designated a DateFilter. It was also converted from M/D/YYYY format to YYYY/MM/DD format to match the format used for the LAPD data.
    As with the LAPD data, we also generated an “Incident Weekday” column and populated it using the same methods used in the LAPD data.<sup id="fnref:27"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:27">27</a></sup> This column was likewise designated a CategoryFilter.</li>

<li><strong>Count1</strong>—This column was renamed “Charge (Count1)” and designated a StringFilter.
    As with ARST_CHRG_CD in the LAPD data, we supplemented this column by adding two new columns, “Charge Code” and “Charge Code Category.” These were added using the same procedures described in </li>
<li><strong>RACE and GENDER</strong>—These columns were designated CategoryFilters, and were renamed “Race” and “Gender,” respectively.</li>
<li><strong>DefendantZipCode</strong>—This column was deleted to lessen the amount of personal information, and to avoid confusion between the location of the incident and the address of the defendant.</li>
<li><strong>DOB</strong>—To reduce the amount of personal information and to put it in similar format to the LAPD data, this column was replaced with an “Age” column. This column was populated using a spreadsheet function<sup id="fnref:28"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:28">28</a></sup> that counted the number of calendar years between the DOB and the IncidentDate. </li>

<h2 id="3-general-trends">3. General Trends</h2>
<p>In this section, general trends within both the LAPD dataset and City Attorney dataset will be discussed. The categories that general trends will be discussed are: race, gender, and location. This is meant to be a broad overview of trends in the datasets.</p>
<h3 id="a-race">A. Race</h3>
<p>According to the LAPD data, the race breakdown of citations for the period 10/31/2017 - 10/30/2019 is: 48,412 Hispanic citations (47%), 27,474 Black citations (27%), 21,605 White citations (21%), 5,096 other race citations (5%), and 790 Asian citations (0.7%).</p>
<p>According to the City Attorney data, the race breakdown of City Attorney cases for the period 1/1/2017 – 9/15/20 is: 79,355 Hispanic cases (47%), 38,719 Black cases (23%), 30,481 (18%) White cases, 11,078 other race cases (6.7%), and 1,260 Asian cases (0.7%). </p>

<p><img alt="City Attorney: Race Breakdown of Cases" src=".././../../static/tracing-criminalization/City%20Attorney%20-%20Race%20Breakdown%20of%20Cases.png"></p>
<p>In comparison, the demographics of Los Angeles County are: 70.8% White (including Hispanic White), White (non-Hispanic) 26.1%, 9.0% Black, 15.4% Asian, and 48.6% Hispanic.<sup id="fnref:31"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:31">31</a></sup> Clearly, there is a strong racial discrepancy in the rates of arrests. Interestingly, the percentages of the race breakdown for the LAPD misdemeanor arrest data and the City Attorney’s case data are roughly equivalent. The only major discrepancy is the decrease in white arrests in the LAPD data (21%) to the percentage of white cases in the City Attorney data (21%). </p>
<p>The following charts break down the most common types of charges according to each racial category. The charts of most common types of charges are taken from the LAPD misdemeanor arrest data. The charge types in the charts are not the specific charges, but instead categories of types of charges that each charge code was categorized into. As demonstrated below, the types of charges vary according to racial group.</p>

<p>Amongst Hispanic misdemeanor arrests, the three most common types of charges are crimes regarding driving under the influence, alcohol related crimes, and possession of drugs related crimes. Similarly, amongst Black misdemeanor arrests, the three most common types of charges are, in order of prevalence, crimes relating to alcohol, possession of drugs charges, and prostitution. Amongst the LAPD data’s 32,633 arrests for alcohol or drug related crimes, 16,256 of the arrestees were Hispanic (49.8%), 7946 of the arrestees were Black (24.3%), 6913 of the arrestees were white (21.2%), 1276 of the arrestees were other races (3.9%), and 199 of the arrestees were Asian (0.6%).</p>

<p>According to a recent Los Angeles Times analysis done in October 2019, the Times found that Los Angeles police officers search Black and Latino people far more often than white people during traffic stops, even though white people are more likely to be found with illegal items.<sup id="fnref:32"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:32">32</a></sup> The analysis found that in Los Angeles during a 10-month period, during police traffic stops 24% of Black drivers and passengers were searched, 16% of Latino drivers and passengers were searched, and 5% of white drivers and passengers were searched. In contrast, the hit rate at which illegal items such as drugs, weapons, or other contraband were found were: 20% of searches of white people, 17% of searches of Black people, 16% of searches of Latino people. Similarly, the LA Times found in another investigation that the LAPD’s Metropolitan Division stopped Black motorists five times their share of the city’s population.<sup id="fnref:33"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:33">33</a></sup> Nearly half of the drivers that the Metropolitan Division stops are Black, while the percentage of drivers that the LAPD in general stops is 28%.<sup id="fnref:34"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:34">34</a></sup> These percentages are far higher than the 9% share that Black residents make up in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>One notable aspect of the race breakdowns is the prevalence of prostitution charges for both Black and Asian arrestees in the LAPD data. Prostitution is the third most common charge type for Black arrestees while prostitution is the first most common charge for Asian arrestees. Of the LAPD dataset’s 7090 arrests for prostitution-related crimes, 3131 of the arrestees were Black (44.1%), 2440 were Hispanic (34.4%), 727 were white (10.3%), 521 were other races (7.3%), and 235 were Asian (3.3%). In a recent article published on August 7, 2019, the LAist examined LAPD’s recent anti-sex trafficking efforts and found that the operations had the impact of criminalizing and catching female sex workers moreso than catching actual sex traffickers.<sup id="fnref:35"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:35">35</a></sup> The piece pointed out that while Black women make up around 9% of Los Angeles’ female population, they account for 65% of the LAPD’s prostitution arrests according to their dataset.<sup id="fnref:36"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:36">36</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="b-gender">B. Gender</h3>
<p>In general, men were arrested and charged with crimes in both the LAPD dataset and the City Attorney dataset more than women were. Below is a gender breakdown of all of the cases in the City Attorney dataset.</p>
<h6 id="city-attorney-data-gender-breakdown-of-cases">City Attorney Data: Gender Breakdown of Cases</h6>
<p><img alt="City Attorney Data: Gender Breakdown of Cases" src=".././../../static/tracing-criminalization/City%20Attorney%20Data%20-%20Gender%20Breakdown%20of%20Cases.png"></p>
<p>However, the gender breakdowns vary when broken down according to race. As seen below, amongst Hispanic arrests had the most skewed ratio of more men arrested than women at 83.2% arrestees men and 16.8% of arrestees women. Black arrestees and white arrestees had similar proportions of men to women ratios, while the data on Asian arrestees demonstrated a huge difference in the ratio. The gender ratio of Asian arrestees is 50.4% men and 49.6% women. The difference in gender ratio may be attributable to the types of charges that people in these racial categories are most frequently arrested for. In the next section, the types of charges broken down by gender and race will be analyzed.</p>

<p>The below table shows the most common types of charges across all demographics. The most common types of charges fall largely into a handful of categories: driving under the influence, battery, domestic violence, and alcohol and drugs related. As discussed in the Los Angeles Times, a significant number of arrests are for driving and illegal substance related arrests.<sup id="fnref:37"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:37">37</a></sup> In particular, the Los Angeles Times report found that Black and Hispanic drivers were stopped far more than white drivers despite having lower hit rates of illegal substances found, and when drivers are stopped is when illegal substances are often found, which result in charges related to illegal substances.<sup id="fnref:38"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:38">38</a></sup> The subsequent tables show the most common charges according to demographic: all demographics, men of all races, women of all races, Black women, Black men, Hispanic women, Hispanic men, white women, white men, Asian women, and Asian men.</p>

<p>As shown by the tables, amongst Black women and Asian women, prostitution is one of the most common charges for which these populations are arrested. The higher prevalence of prostitution charges may explain for the higher ratio of women to men arrestees amongst the Asian racial group dataset. As discussed previously, prostitution arrests of Black women and Asian women has been a continuing issue in Los Angeles.<sup id="fnref:39"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:39">39</a></sup> The report will further delve into the issue of criminalization of prostitution in Section 5.</p>
<h3 id="c-location">C. Location</h3>
<p><img alt="Map of Citations Per Resident by Council District" src=".././../../static/tracing-criminalization/LAPD%20Citations%20Per%20Resident%20by%20Council%20District%20Map.png"></p>
<p>In general, the LAPD did not issue citations uniformly throughout the city. The number and kind of citations, as well as the demographics of their recipients, vary widely by area. Central L.A., represented by City Council districts 13, 14, and 1, is home to the city’s largest levels of criminalization.</p>
<p>Districts 13 and 14 saw the greatest overall number of citations in the LAPD data, with 11,256 and 10,793 citations respectively. District 5 on the West Side saw the fewest with only 2,169.<sup id="fnref:40"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:40">40</a></sup> These trends remain constant when controlling for each district’s population size: Districts 13 and 14 each had around 0.044 citations per resident, and District 1, located between them, had 0.034. District 5 had the lowest rate of citations per resident, 0.009.<sup id="fnref:41"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:41">41</a></sup></p>
<p><img alt="Heatmap of Citations Issued" src=".././../../static/tracing-criminalization/LAPD%20Total%20Citations%20Heatmap.png"></p>
<p>Of course, a district is not a monolithic entity with uniform crime and policing throughout. It is a set of lines drawn on a map, that cut across the streets and neighborhoods that define city life. The reason why Districts 13, 14, and 1 all have very high citation numbers is because they contain several neighborhoods with very high concentrations of citations: Downtown, Westlake, and Hollywood.<sup id="fnref:42"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:42">42</a></sup> District 6 also has a relatively-high number of citations, at 7,750. This is driven in part by a concentrated cluster of citations along Sepulveda Boulevard, particularly between Saticoy and Vanowen. Other large clusters of citations throughout the city were issued around Venice Beach, Sawtelle, Boyle Heights, San Pedro, Canoga Park, and along South Figueroa Street.</p>
<h4 id="racial-disparity-across-districts">Racial Disparity Across Districts</h4>
<p><img alt="Black Share of Population vs Black Share of Citations, by Council District" src=".././../../static/tracing-criminalization/LAPD%20Data%20-%20Black%20Share%20of%20Population%20vs%20Black%20Share%20of%20Citations.png"></p>
<p>Racial trends in citations also vary across areas. In particular, the criminalization of Black residents is starkly different in different areas of the city. Granted, criminalization is disproportionate everywhere; Black people were cited at a higher rate than the general population in every district.<sup id="fnref:43"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:43">43</a></sup> And citywide, they were cited at 2.79 times the general rate. However, this number is heavily skewed upward by the three Central L.A. districts. The most extreme is District 13, where Black people are issued citations at 7.13 times the rate of the general population. By contrast, the lowest levels of disproportionality, 1.51 and 1.63, are found in districts 8 and 10, the two districts with the highest proportion of Black residents.</p>
<p><img alt="Citations Issued per Person by Race and District" src=".././../../static/tracing-criminalization/LAPD%20Data%20-%20Citations%20per%20Person%20by%20Race.png"></p>
<p>In District 5 on the West Side, the disproportionality index is 6.02, even higher than one of the Central L.A. districts. However, District 5 also issued the fewest citations overall, whereas the Central L.A. districts issued the most. Central L.A.’s combination of severe racial disproportionality and large numbers of citations means that the Black population there is criminalized at far higher rates than anywhere else in the city. Across all districts, roughly 0.06 citations were issued for every Black person, compared to 0.02 for the overall population.<sup id="fnref:44"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:44">44</a></sup> But in District 13, that rate is 0.33. The data do not show how many individuals were issued multiple citations. However, if that number is small, then nearly a third of District 13’s Black residents were issued a citation in the last two years. In any case, Central L.A.’s Black population faces extreme levels of criminalization.</p>
<h4 id="common-citations-by-location">Common Citations by Location</h4>
<p><img alt="Relative Prevalence of Charge Categories by District" src=".././../../static/tracing-criminalization/LAPD%20Data%20-%20Relative%20Prevalence%20of%20Charge%20Categories%20by%20Council%20District.png"></p>
<p>While some types of citation were relatively evenly-distributed throughout the city, others were highly location-specific. After controlling for each district’s overall citation count, the three categories of citation that vary the most by district are prostitution-related, alcohol-related, and homelessness-related.<sup id="fnref:45"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:45">45</a></sup> Prostitution-related citations are rare in most districts, but they made up more than a fifth of the citations issued in Districts 6 and 8, and around fifteen percent of those issued in District 10. This is largely because these districts contain several highly-cited areas: District 8 has the stretch of Figueroa south of Gage Avenue; District 6 has Sepulveda Boulevard between Saticoy and Victory; and Districts 8 and 10 both have lengths of S Western Avenue that are very highly-cited for prostitution-related charges.<sup id="fnref:46"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>Alcohol-related citations are relatively-common in the three Central L.A. districts, as well as District 11 on the West Side, but they are relatively rare elsewhere. The highest concentrations are in Westlake, Downtown, Hollywood, and along Venice Beach. Less-concentrated hotspots include Sawtelle, Van Nuys, Cypress Park, and Boyle Heights.</p>
<p>Homelessness-related citations are somewhat more diffuse than those related to prostitution or alcohol. The highest concentrations are around Downtown, Westlake, and Hollywood. Venice Beach also has a large number of homelessness-related citations. Citations are uniformly common throughout Hollywood, whereas the cluster in Westlake can be attributed largely to MacArthur Park. Downtown, the citations are generally clustered between 4th Street and 7th Street, southeast of Maple; in addition to a high concentration at the intersection of Arcadia and Spring.</p>
<p>Intuition might suggest that the high number of homelessness-related citations in Central L.A. is merely a function of the high homeless population there. However, across the fifteen districts, homeless population and homelessness-related citations are only weakly correlated.<sup id="fnref:47"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:47">47</a></sup> District 9 had the second-highest homeless population of all the districts, at 3,826. Yet police there only issued 213 homelessness-related citations.</p>
<p><img alt="Homeless Count vs. Homelessness-Related Citations by District" src=".././../../static/tracing-criminalization/LAPD%20and%20LAHSA%20Data%20-%20Homeless%20Count%20vs%20Citations.png"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, District 13, represented by Mitch O’Farrell, had fewer homeless people, but it issued homeless-related citations at a staggering rate: nearly one citation for nearly every homeless person in the district. This is noteworthy given O’Farrell’s efforts to reinstate LAMC Section 41.18(d), the ban on sitting, lying, and sleeping. His district has the most citations, the most extreme racial disparity, the most homelessness-related citations, and the most homeless citations relative to the homeless population. Mitch O’Farrell’s legislative agenda should be understood in light of these facts.</p>
<h2 id="4-trends-in-trespass-related-crimes">4. Trends in Trespass-Related Crimes</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Our group decided that two people ought to examine a crime or general issue related to the criminalization of homelessness in a more specific and deliberate manner. Prior to obtaining or coding any LAPD or City Attorney Data, we spoke with a couple public defenders, and in particular our interview with Drew Haven provided Ilan and I with some initial ideas about certain crimes to look at, once we received the data. He told us about his experience as a public defender and his observations about the way in which homeless people are being criminalized. He immediately said that the biggest issue he sees is the frequency of trespass cases brought by the City Attorney’s office, often against unhoused people who may have been sleeping on the beach.<sup id="fnref:48"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:48">48</a></sup></p>
<p>When we received the LAPD and City Attorney data, we included made a sub-category for trespass charges, but then grouped this into the larger category of Issues Related to Homelessness. In both data sets, trespass-related charges made up the largest number of arrests or citations (for the ease of the paper, I will be referring to LAPD interactions as arrests, although this often includes citations) from the LAPD data, as well as the largest number of charges from the City Attorney’s data. There is the obvious limitation in reaching this conclusion in that the data sets did not contain any information on individual’s housing status, but we grouped trespass into this category based on the conversation with Drew, as well as the broad language of the relevant statutes that criminalizes people for being on private property, or even “threatening property rights.” Therefore, this conclusion hinges on assumptions that trespass laws are likely to negatively affect unhoused people, as they criminalize presence on private property.</p>
<p>This section aims to look deeper into the issue of trespass and examine any arrest trends, citation trends, and charging trends that occur along racial or gender lines. Further, it will discuss how trespass charges interact with the overall campaign to decriminalize quality-of-life crimes, and the particular challenges that may accompany advocating a change in the construction and enforcement of trespass laws.</p>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>My goal in analyzing trespass charges was to try and find patterns in the initial violation of the trespass charge and then determine if there were any similarities or differences in the shape these patterns took in the prosecutorial stage of the process. </p>
<p>I first looked at the LAPD trespass data and found that the two main charges the LAPD issues against individuals are <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=S">California Penal Code S</a>ection (CAPC) 602 violations, which charges a misdemeanor to “<em>any person who willfully commits a trespass by any of the following acts”</em> and provides a list of (a) through (x).<sup id="fnref:49"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:49">49</a></sup> Additionally, outside of any 602 charge, the other common charge was Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) 41.24, the “<em>trespass on private property”</em> ordinance.<sup id="fnref:50"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:50">50</a></sup> Both of these codes have subcategories. For example, the most commonly charged sub-category of 602 was 602(k), “<em>entering lands, whether unenclosed or enclosed, for the purpose of injuring any property or property rights or with the intention of interfering with, obstructing, or injuring any lawful business or occupation carried on by the owner of the land…”</em>. But due to the LAPD’s messy data, this code can be written as 602(k) or 602k or just 602. There were similar issues with 41.24, where the top charge was 41.24(a), <em>“no person shall enter or be present on private property not open to the general public without the consent of the owner, the owner’s agent, or the person in lawful possession, where signs forbidding entry are displayed as provided in Subsection (f)</em>.”</p>
<p>For that reason, I decided to first look at the trends in the overall trespass category in AwesomeTable. Then, in the box labeled “Arrest Charge,” I typed “602,” which limited the data only to 602 charges. I did the same thing for 41.24. From this information, I made tables about the number of arrests, the gender breakdown, racial breakdown, the misdemeanor/infraction breakdown, and the top hours with the greatest number of arrests. That information is captured in Table One.</p>
<p>From there, I wanted to look specifically at race to see if that would illuminate any information on enforcement discrepancies. To do this, I followed the methodology as above, but limited each section by putting the race as “H”, then “B”, then “W”. Since the number of “O” was so much lower than these three in the general category, I did not look further into “O”. The data obtained from this technique is captured in tables T2, T3, and T4.</p>
<p>After complying and organizing the LAPD data, and since I wanted to “follow” the path of these cases, I next turned to organizing the City Attorney data set in the same way. Like the LAPD trespass data, 602 and 41.24 charges were the most prevalent in the City Attorney trespass data. I followed a similar technique for the City Attorney data, first looking at the general trespass trends, and then typing in “602” and “41.24”, respectively. However, the data captured different metrics, due to the difference in procedural stature. With the City Attorney data, I focused on whether the misdemeanor was filed or rejected, and the subcategories within this general category: misdemeanor filed – OR (own recognizance – released); misdemeanor filed – custody; misdemeanor rejected – lack of sufficient evidence; misdemeanor rejected – interest of justice; misdemeanor rejected – other reason, memo in file. These were the five that occurred in the highest numbers but did not cover all of the categories. Misdemeanor filed – VA; misdemeanor filed – warrant; and hearing were other categories, but since the numbers were much lower, I did not include them in the tables. Therefore, the percentages are not entirely encompassing of all of the misdemeanors filed or rejected.</p>
<p>I made these tables in the same way as the LAPD data. First, I recorded the information without limiting the race for general trespass, 602, and 41.24. Then, I limited the responses just to “H”, the “B”, and “W”. The data obtained from this method is captured in T5, T6, T7, and T8. </p>
<h3 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h3>
<h4 id="a-general">A. General</h4>
<p>As mentioned above, trespass related chargesd make up the highest number of charges under our “Issues Related to Homelessness Section” in the LAPD data (see Image 1). Out of the 17,477 arrests or citations in this section, 4,724 were Trespass related, or 27% of all arrests or citations. However, the charge with the highest number of citations or arrests is <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/los_angeles/latest/lamc/0-0-0-128514">LAMC 41.18</a>(D), commonly known as the “sit, lie, sleep” law. When the violations reach the prosecutorial stage, the percentage of trespass crimes increases in correlation with “homelessness-related” crimes in general. Out of the 8,198 Homelessness related cases that come in contact with the City Attorney’s office, 6,975 of these are trespass charges, or 85.4% of all homelessness-related cases (see Image 2). A reason for this jump in percentage between the two datasets may be the predominance of PC §602 in the trespass category – a state-level misdemeanor charge -- versus a municipal code violation. However, it indicates that a trespass related arrest will likely carry criminal justice consequences, as the City Attorney’s office accepts over 59% of the trespass misdemeanor charges (see Table 5). </p>

<p>Looking aggregately at both data sets, there are similar patterns in the gender and racial breakdown of people arrested, and then charged with these crimes. This is not surprising, considering that the City Attorney receives 83.7% of their cases from the LAPD.<sup id="fnref:51"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:51">51</a></sup> Around 74% of those arrested and those charged with a trespass related crime are male, and around 26% female. 45.2% of all people arrested with trespass related crimes are Hispanic, as categorized by the LAPD, and 43.2% of the people charged with these same crimes are Hispanic, as categorized by the City Attorney.<sup id="fnref:52"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:52">52</a></sup> This is almost double the white and black arrests and charging patterns. White people make up 26.1% of all arrests or citations from the LAPD, and 26.2% of all charges brought by the City Attorney’s office. Black people make up 23.3% of all arrests or citations from the LAPD, and 25% of all charges.<sup id="fnref:53"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:53">53</a></sup> In comparison, the demographics of Los Angeles County are: 70.8% White (including Hispanic White), White (non-Hispanic) 26.1%, 9.0% Black, 15.4% Asian, and 48.6% Hispanic.<sup id="fnref:54"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:54">54</a></sup> The LAPD and City Attorney data, generalized as it is, demonstrate three key takeaways: that Hispanic people are being both arrested and charged with trespass crimes at a significantly higher rates than other races, black people are being arrested and charged with trespass related crimes in disproportionately high numbers, and that policing trends are highly correlated with charging trends.</p>
<h4 id="b-race-based-analysis-lapd-data">B. Race-Based Analysis -- LAPD Data</h4>
<p>Other patterns emerge when looking closer at patterns within racial arrests, and how these compare across races. As noted in the methodology section, I broke down each racial analysis by looking at certain facts in the general trespass category, and then within 602 charges and 41.24. In general, there were similar breakdowns across races of the percentage of charges that were 602 and 41.24 – around 50% and 31%, respectively.<sup id="fnref:55"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:55">55</a></sup> This is important to note because a 602 violation requires a misdemeanor charge, and 99% of those arrested for a 602 violation receive a misdemeanor, versus 41.24 violation can lead to either an infraction or a misdemeanor citation. </p>
<p>However, there are notable differences in gender and 41.24 misdemeanor versus infraction between races in the LAPD data. For Hispanic arrests, between general trespass, 602, and 41.24, the male/female breakdown remains consistently around 75%/25%.<sup id="fnref:56"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:56">56</a></sup> However, looking at black arrests, the percentage of males arrested increases. The divide in the general trespass category is 81.9% male to 18.1% female. This remains around the same for 602 charges, but then for 41.24 charges, it changes to 85%/15%, although this could be from the smaller number of charges in that category.<sup id="fnref:57"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:57">57</a></sup> Finally, white arrests show the opposite trend. In the general trespass category, 66.2% of arrests were male and 33.8% were female. When looking only at 602 charges, 61.8% of arrests are male and 38.2% female. When looking at 41.24 violations, 70.4% are male, and 29.6% female.<sup id="fnref:58"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:58">58</a></sup> Taken together, this shows that black men are arrested for trespass violations at a higher rate than other males, and white women are being arrested at a higher rate than other females. Or conversely, white males are being arrested at a lower rate than other individuals. </p>
<p>Another notable pattern is that the breakdown between misdemeanor or infraction filings for 41.24 differs by race. Within that charge, 60.1% of Hispanic people receive a misdemeanor citation for a 41.24 violation, 56.8% of black people who violate 41.24 receive a misdemeanor citation, but only 50.7% of white people in violation of 41.24 receive misdemeanor charge. It is particularly striking to see the black versus white comparison, since there were more white individuals recorded in violation of 41.24 (406) than black individuals (361), yet the number of white people who received misdemeanor charge was virtually the same as black people (206 to 205, respectively).<sup id="fnref:59"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:59">59</a></sup> This is particularly significant because of the criminal justice implications. A misdemeanor is a more serious charge, and this data contains no information on why police choose to cite someone for a 602 charge versus a 41.24 charge, nor any information on why they would cite someone for an infraction versus a misdemeanor for the same LAMC violation. And it may support what we already know about policing tactics – that communities of color are generally disproportionately policed in comparison to white communities, and this can extend to discretionary police tactics that over-criminalize these same communities of color.<sup id="fnref:60"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:60">60</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="c-race-based-analysis-city-attorney-data">C. Race-Based Analysis -- City Attorney Data</h4>
<p>As noted above, the City Attorney racial and gender breakdowns generally reflect the LAPD data. Around 43% of all trespass charges are brought against Hispanic people, 26.2% against White people, and 25% against Black people. The same gender breakdown patterns within each racial category exist as well.<sup id="fnref:61"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:61">61</a></sup></p>
<p>However, some patterns emerge when looking at the different percentages of “misdemeanor filed” versus “misdemeanor rejected”; and within “misdemeanor filed”, the percentage of people who were released on their own recognizance (“OR”) or taken into custody. In Hispanic charges, around 62% of the trespass cases were filed as misdemeanors, and within this group, 53.3% were released OR and 46.7% were taken into custody. However, when only looking at 602 charges, the numbers change to 44.8% of people released on OR versus 55.2% taken into custody – although this is consistent with the general charging data related to 602.<sup id="fnref:62"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:62">62</a></sup> Both situations are of concern – being released OR and then failing to appear in court can lead to an arrest warrant and further entanglement with the criminal justice system. Being taken into custody is completely disruptive to one’s life, removes one from their family and job, and other likely consequences.</p>
<p>The City Attorney filed around 52% of trespass misdemeanors received against black individuals, but within this general trespass category, only 43.6% of people were released OR, compared to 56.1% taken into custody. The percentage of those reportedly in custody rose when looking only at 602 charges. 61.8% of black individuals compared to 48.2% released OR.<sup id="fnref:63"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:63">63</a></sup> These numbers show that the percentage of black people taken into custody over a trespass-related charge is greater than the percentage of both Hispanic individuals and white individuals (discussed below).</p>
<p>Finally, data about charges against white people reveal that a lower percentage of white people charged with trespass-related crimes end up in custody. Out of the general trespass pool, 56.7% were released OR while 43.3% were taken into custody. Of the 602 charges, it was split almost 50/50 as to custody/OR – by far the most equitable division between custody and OR among the races analyzed.<sup id="fnref:64"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:64">64</a></sup> The fact that white people charged with a 602 crime are more likely to be released OR rather than taken into custody again supports an argument about the reality of race’s role in the criminal justice system. The LAPD numbers reveal it – white arrestees are more likely to receive infractions when the opportunity arises, as it does with 41.24 cases – and the City Attorney numbers also show a similar pattern of favorable enforcement when the individual charged is white. There are other factors present as well, like white families typically having hired incomes, which could allow more opportunities to post bail, but overall these numbers indicate a difference in treatment by the City Attorney when the defendant is white. </p>
<h4 id="d-data-analysis-conclusions">D. Data Analysis Conclusions</h4>
<p>This data analysis is a first step – it has only been looked at by one person, and the information revealed is aggregate at best. However, it indicates that even at this aggregate level, there are racial disparities present in both the way that the LAPD is enforcing trespass crimes, particularly 602 charges and 41.24 charges, and then in the way that the City Attorney handles misdemeanor cases received.</p>
<p>Much of the discourse around decriminalization of quality of life misdemeanors centers around laws that more perhaps more obviously criminalize behavior necessary for unhoused people to survive. For example, the “sit, lie, sleep” law (LAMC 41.18d) has received a lot of attention in the wake of <em>Martin v. Boise</em>, and the City of Los Angeles agreement not to enforce the ordinance overnight.<sup id="fnref:65"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:65">65</a></sup> But there are still so many crimes on the books that regulate where people can or cannot be that are not subject to such limitations, like these trespass laws. And further, the LAPD is only increasing their patrol of homeless communities as the number of unhoused people grows, and the publicity surrounding it does as well.</p>
<p>Further, there is a history of the LAPD using trespass violations to target specific groups of people.<sup id="fnref:66"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:66">66</a></sup> In discussing the issue of trespass with Professor Narro, he talked about how the police used trespass laws to arrest or cite day laborers as they waited to get work. The LA Times article, written in the nineties, appears to reflect the sentiment of the time -- the fear that day laborers were “intimidating customers… harassing women, … defecating in public.”<sup id="fnref:67"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:67">67</a></sup>  The article clearly reflects how business owners appealed to the LAPD to start using these trespass laws to remove these men from their sidewalks. However, Professor Narro noted that the campaign to increase day laborer’s rights was successful in fighting the LAPD enforcement of these crimes by challenging the City Attorney’s office to actually establish the elements of the crime in court. However, trespass is still being used as a weapon against day laborers. Home Depot has been trying to use anti-trespass laws to ensure that people looking for work do not do so on the premises.<sup id="fnref:68"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:68">68</a></sup></p>
<p>There is a clear pattern and capability of using trespass laws in specific ways to target certain groups of people. Drew confirmed that the biggest issue he sees related to the criminalization of homelessness is the expansive use of trespass laws against unhoused people – “for sleeping on the beach or sleeping on a bench.”<sup id="fnref:69"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:69">69</a></sup> Los Angeles has two crimes that an officer can use to either cite and arrest someone, and these crimes often lead to further criminal justice issues and could foreseeably lead to immigration consequences as well.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<p>The next foreseeable step is further data analysis of this issue, with more people looking at these numbers and providing their own opinions. Further, more investigation needs to be done about the connection between trespass charges and homelessness. This data does not give any income or housing information, the only corroborating facts are from conversations with Drew and Professor Narro.</p>
<p>Beyond just data analysis and thinking about some of organization strategies, we also need to learn more about the discretionary decisions by the LAPD and the City Attorney’s office. For example, what facts are more likely to lead to a 602 violation versus a 41.24, given that the language of the statutes seem very similar, but 602 charges leads to more severe criminal justice consequences. Similarly, what are the facts that lead the City Attorney’s office to reject a trespass case. Professor Narro spoke about challenging the veracity of trespass charges brought against day laborers in the nineties, showing how the case failed on elements of the crime as part of the strategy to reduce the LAPD enforcement.</p>
<p>Additionally, while it seems highly unlikely that one could mount a successful decriminalization campaign against trespass-related crimes, considering their status as common law crimes and the general attitude of property rights, perhaps change can hinge on working towards different enforcement goals. If the LAPD feels compelled to continue enforcing these laws, a campaign can start by pressuring them only to issue 41.24 infractions, versus 41.24 misdemeanors or 602 misdemeanors.</p>
<h2 id="5-trends-in-prostitution-criminalization">5. Trends in Prostitution Criminalization</h2>
<h3 id="introduction_1">Introduction</h3>
<p>This next portion of the report will discuss the specific issue of the criminalization of prostitution related crimes in Los Angeles, and will analyze and breakdown the data we received from the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office (“City Attorney”) and the Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”). Because both of the prostitution related data sets overlap and are highly similar, this section will primarily analyze the slightly larger City Attorney data set.</p>
<p>This topic was chosen in part because of the prevalence of prostitution related crimes in the data sets we received, in addition to a conversation that we had with an Los Angeles Public Defender where the criminalization of prostitution was identified as a problematic issue of criminalization where additional research could be of value. As we began analyzing the first data set that we received from the LAPD’s office and began thinking about how to approach this report, our group was very interested in examining both broader trends in the criminalization of low-level offenses in Los Angeles, as well as the criminalization of specific types of behaviors. In an initial interview with a Los Angeles Public Defender, the criminalization of prostitution and particularly the problematic trend of sex work criminalization being caught up in anti-trafficking efforts was suggested as a highly relevant problem worth exploring. Once our group first received the LAPD data and began to get a better sense of the type of low-level offenses that were being criminalized in Los Angeles, it became very clear that prostitution related crimes made up a significant portion of the data set.</p>
<h3 id="methodology_1">Methodology</h3>
<p>Before breaking down the trends and patterns in prostitution related crimes in the City Attorney data set, it is important to discuss how we categorized the various prostitution related crimes for purposes of our own data analysis, as well the existing penal codes that criminalize prostitution. After initially examining the data and considering the different types of prostitution charges that were present in the data set, we created a single broad category of “Prostitution”, before creating six different sub categories within it, based off of the different types of prostitution related offenses that were appearing. These subcategories included “prostitution,” “solicitation,” “loitering with intent to prostitute,” “escort related services,” “supervision of prostitution,” and “other prostitution”. </p>
<p>In regard to the specific charges identified within each subcategory, in “Prostitution” we placed <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=S">California Penal Code S</a>ection (CAPC) 647(b)(1) violations which charges a misdemeanor of disorderly conduct to an individual who “<em>solicits, or who agrees to engage in, or who engages in, any act of prostitution with the intent to receive compensation, money, or anything of value from another person.”</em><sup id="fnref:70"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:70">70</a></sup>  “Solicitation” contained CAPC Section 647(b)(2) violations which similarly makes it a misdemeanor for “<em>An individual who solicits, or who agrees to engage in, or who engages in, any act of prostitution with another person who is 18 years of age or older in exchange for the individual providing compensation, money, or anything of value to the other person</em>.”<sup id="fnref:71"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:71">71</a></sup> In “Loitering with intent to prostitute” we added CAPC Section 653.22(a) charges which make it a misdemeanor for “<em>for any person to loiter in any public place with the intent to commit prostitution… [where] intent is evidenced by acting in a manner and under circumstances that openly demonstrate the purpose of inducing, enticing, or soliciting prostitution, or procuring another to commit prostitution</em>,”<sup id="fnref:72"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:72">72</a></sup>  as well as Section 647(d) charges which similarly criminalized individuals “<em>who loiters in or about any toilet open to the public for the purpose of engaging in or soliciting any lewd or lascivious or any unlawful act</em>.”<sup id="fnref:73"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:73">73</a></sup> In “Supervision of prostitution” we placed CAPC Section 653.23(a)(1) violations which make it a misdemeanor to “<em>Direct, supervise, recruit, or otherwise aid another person in the commission of a violation of subdivision(b) of section 647 or subdivision (a) of Section 653.22.</em>”<sup id="fnref:74"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:74">74</a></sup> “Escort related services” contained the only municipal penal code charge of <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/los_angeles/latest/lamc/0-0-0-192066">LAMC 103.107.1</a>(b) which provides that <em>“no person shall conduct, manage or carry on any escort bureau without a written permit from the Board. No permit under this section shall be issued to, or in the name of, any organization, group, corporation, partnership or any entity other than an individual person. The business may be advertised and carried on by the permittee under a fictitious name in the manner permitted by law if such fictitious name is first approved by the Board.”</em><sup id="fnref:75"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:75">75</a></sup> Lastly, in “Other Prostitution” we placed prostitution related crimes such as CAPC Section 315 which makes it a misdemeanor to keep “<em>a house of ill-fame in this state, resorted to for the purposes of prostitution or lewdness, or who willfully resides in such house, is guilty of a misdemeanor; and in all prosecutions for keeping or resorting to such a house common repute may be received as competent evidence of the character of the house, the purpose for which it is kept or used, and the character of the women inhabiting or resorting to it,</em>”<sup id="fnref:76"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:76">76</a></sup> as well as CAPC Section 316 violations which makes it a misdemeanor to keep “<em>any disorderly house, or any house for the purpose of assignation or prostitution, or any house of public resort, by which the peace, comfort, or decency of the immediate neighborhood is habitually disturbed, or who keeps any inn in a disorderly manner; and every person who lets any apartment or tenement, knowing that it is to be used for the purpose of assignation or prostitution</em>.”<sup id="fnref:77"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:77">77</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="data-analysis_1">Data Analysis</h3>
<h4 id="a-general_1">A. General</h4>
<p>The data set we received from the City Attorney in response to the ACLU’s PRA request indicated that prostitution charges made up 4.8% of the total 166,429 charges included in the City Attorney crime data. There have been 8,060 total prostitution charges in Los Angeles from January 1st 2017 to September 15th, 2019, indicating that roughly 383 charges are brought every month in Los Angeles. In regard to the penalties imposed on these charges, as well as the agency source of these charges, each of the 8,060 prostitution related charges were classified as misdemeanors, with 98.2% of the charges sourced from the LAPD and .5% coming from Affirmative Citation Enforcement. Additionally, the source of these prostitution charges come almost entirely from the state penal code, as eight of the nine prostitution related charges discussed in the methodology session are based in the California penal code, whereas the only charge originating from the Los Angeles Municipal Code is that which criminalizes escort services. </p>
<p>Regarding the type of prostitution charges that appeared in the data set, there were eight types of prostitution related charges (listed in order of amount from most to least occurrences).  </p>
<ul>
<li>CAPC Section 647(b)(1): Criminalizes individuals who solicit or engage in or agree to acts of prostitution in exchange for compensation;<sup id="fnref:78"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:78">78</a></sup></li>
<li>CAPC Section 647(b)(2): Criminalizes individuals who solicit or seek out prostitution and compensate prostitutes in exchange for sexual services;<sup id="fnref:79"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:79">79</a></sup></li>
<li>CAPC Section 653.22(a): Criminalizes loitering with intent to prostitute oneself;<sup id="fnref:80"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:80">80</a></sup></li>
<li>CAPC Section 653.23(a)(1): Criminalizes the assisting, recruiting or supervising of individuals engaging in prostitution;<sup id="fnref:81"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:81">81</a></sup></li>
<li>LAMC Section 103.107.1(b): Criminalizes escort services conducted without a permit;<sup id="fnref:82"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:82">82</a></sup></li>
<li>CAPC Section 315: Criminalizes the keeping of a house of ill fame for prostitution purposes;<sup id="fnref:83"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:83">83</a></sup></li>
<li>CAPC Section 316: Criminalizes the keeping of a disorderly house for prostitution purposes where the peace of the immediate neighborhood is disturbed;<sup id="fnref:84"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:84">84</a></sup></li>
<li>CAPC Section 647(d); Criminalizes loitering around a public toilet for purposes of engaging in lewd, lascivious or unlawful acts;<sup id="fnref:85"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:85">85</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Three of these charges accounted for the vast majority of the 8,060 prostitution related charges. Section 647(b)(1) (criminalizes individuals who engage in prostitution in exchange for compensation) was the most common charge with 3,190 total charges, Section 647(b)(2) (criminalizes individuals seeking out/soliciting prostitution) was the second most common charge with 2,372 total charges, and Section 653.22(a) (criminalizes loitering with intent to prostitute oneself) was the third most common charge with 2,199 total charges. The rest of the charges were far less frequent, with only 161 charges occurring for assisting/supervising individuals engaged in prostitution, 79 charges against unpermitted escorting, 56 charges of keeping a disorderly house or house of ill fame, and 5 charges for loitering around a public toilet for purposes of engaging in lascivious acts.</p>
<h4 id="b-location">B. Location</h4>
<p>The below map provides a useful breakdown of which city council districts, neighborhoods and areas are experiencing significant policing of prostitution. On the map, the red circles indicate areas with higher concentrations of prostitution charges, the yellow circles indicate areas with intermediate levels of prostitution charges, whereas the blue circles indicate minimal amounts of charges. </p>
<p><img alt="Clusters of Sex Work-Related Charges" src=".././../../static/tracing-criminalization/LAPD%20Data%20-%20AT%20Concentrations%20of%20Sex%20Work%20Arrests.png"></p>
<p>While it is slightly difficult to determine by looking at the map, the data indicates that charges are most commonly brought against prostitution related activities in Van Nuys and North Hollywood, as well as areas of Central Los Angeles and South Los Angeles. This type of data mapping is essential in terms of supporting the long terms goals of this project (providing compelling data and research necessary to convince policymakers of the need for criminalization), as it highlights which Council and Supervisor districts are and are not experiencing high rates of prostitution enforcement. For example, Van Nuys, which has some of the highest concentrations of prostitution charges in our data set, is part of Los Angeles Council District 6, and is represented by Councilmember Nury Martinez, who has made combating sex trafficking a priority.<sup id="fnref:86"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:86">86</a></sup> This type of data suggesting that the criminalization of low level prostitution crimes is pervasive in her district could potentially be valuable in future efforts to minimize the criminalization impact that anti-trafficking efforts have upon the sex workers themselves. For purposes of identifying where prostitution charges are being brought in relation to each Los Angeles City Council District, see the below map (darker shades of purple represent higher concentrations of charges) indicating that District 6 (Nury Martinez) and District 8 (Harris-Dawson) experience the highest rates of prostitution charges.</p>

<p>The location of the prostitution charges do not significantly change when individual prostitution charges are analyzed separately. This makes sense as the locations where individuals purchase prostitution services are very likely the same locations where such services are offered. Below are maps of the most common types of prostitution charges listed in the data set, again indicating that the vast majority of prostitution enforcement takes place in Van Nuys and North Hollywood as well as areas of Central Los Angeles and South Los Angeles. </p>

<h4 id="c-gender">C. Gender</h4>
<p>The gender breakdown of the total amount of prostitution charges was relatively even. Of the 8,060 total prostitution related charges, 56.4% of these charges were against women, while 43.3% of the charges were against men. This relatively even percentage breakdown was slightly surprising at first, as the initial expectation was that women would be disproportionately impacted by prostitution charges. However, there are several possible explanations for this.</p>
<p>First, while prostitution charges against sex workers themselves are largely brought against women, this is balanced out by the fact that charges against individuals purchasing prostitution services almost exclusively are brought against men. The data indicates that the prostitution related charges brought against prostitutes <em>themselves</em> absolutely has a significant disproportionate impact on women. Women accounted for 89.7% of charges brought under CAPC 647(b)(1) (the most common charge in the data set) which criminalizes prostitutes who are soliciting or engaging in prostitution acts. Additionally, women accounted for 67.1% of charges brought under CAPC 653.22(a) (the third most common charge in the data set), which criminalizes loitering for the purpose of prostituting oneself. However, just as significantly, men made up 97.1% of the 2,309 charges brought under CAPC 647(b)(2) which criminalizes individuals purchasing prostitution services, and 74.5% of the charges under CAPC 653.23(a)(1) which criminalizes the assisting, recruiting or supervising of individuals engaging in prostitution. </p>
<p>These distinctions in which charges disproportionately impact which gender has important implications. First, this indicates that the criminalization of prostitution related crimes not only adversely impacts sex workers, but those who are purchasing prostitution services. This is a finding which significantly expands the scope of who “the criminalization of prostitution” impacts. However, it is important to keep in mind that the real-life impacts of such criminalization efforts are unlikely to be equal. First, sex workers rely on prostitution to make a living, and thus criminalization efforts threaten job and economic stability in a way that the criminalization of the purchasing of prostitution does not. Second, it is very possible that sex workers do not have the same level of economic stability as those purchasing sex work, and thus are far more vulnerable to cycles of poverty and incarceration, perpetuated by jail time and fines. </p>
<p>Second, an additional possible explanation for this relatively even gender breakdown is that the data possibly categorizes trans women as males, which may result in men being overrepresented in the data set. The data only has categories of “Male” and “Female” and as there is no indication in the data as to how trans women were categorized, it is a very real possibility that trans women whose identification might be reflected as “male” on official identification documents, were categorized as men during enforcement efforts. As a result, men may be overrepresented in this data set and thus the data may be slightly skewed. In terms of thinking of additional ways to both improve the accuracy of this data set as well as to better understand the impact of prostitution criminalization on transgender men and women, this type of improvement in gender catergorization is an important consideration to be made in future attempts to analyze this issue. </p>
<h4 id="d-race">D. Race</h4>
<p>The data shows that African Americans are disproportionately impacted and drastically overrepresented in prostitution related charges. The City Attorney data set indicates that 37.8% (3,053 charges) of the 8,062 prostitution charges were brought against African Americans, 34.1% (2,754) were brought against Hispanics, 9.4% (755) were brought against Caucasians, and 2.1% (174 charges) were brought against Asians. The percentage of charges brought against African Americans (37.8%) is not only a drastic overrepresentation of the African American makeup up Los Angeles City as a whole but is also a significant increase compared to the African American representation in this entire data set, where African Americans made up 23.2% of all charges in the data set (which is still far higher than their proportion of the general population).<sup id="fnref:87"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:87">87</a></sup> While this level of overrepresentation is significant, it is important to note that without additional statistics as to which racial demographics more commonly engage in selling or buying prostitution services, conclusions as to whether such overrepresentation is a result of discriminatory enforcement will be difficult to make.</p>
<p>Analysis of the racial breakdown for the different types of charges again reveals a significant difference between the charges criminalizing individuals who prostitute themselves as opposed to charges against those who seek out and offer compensation in exchange for prostitution services. African Americans (and particularly women, as discussed in the above section) are even more significantly overrepresented in charges brought against prostitutes themselves. African Americans made up 51.5% of the 3,190 CAPC 647(b)(1) charges, which charges prostitutes soliciting or engaging in prostitution acts, and 56.1% of the 2,202 charges brought under CAPC 653.22(a) which criminalizes loitering for the purpose of prostituting oneself. This is a significant increase from 37.8%, the proportion of which African Americans made up when examining all prostitution charges. The data additionally showed that not only do African Americans make up the majority of charges targeting sex workers themselves, but account for 65.2% of the 161 CAPC 653.23(a)(1) violations, which criminalizes the assisting, recruiting or supervising individuals engaging in prostitution. </p>
<p>While the percentage of charges brought against African Americans significantly increased for charges brought against prostitutes themselves, African Americans only made up 7.1% of the 2,372 CAPC 647(b)(2) violations which criminalizes individuals who compensate prostitutes in exchange for sexual services. The percentage difference from 56.1% to 7.1% is enormous, and is a strong indicator that African Americans are far more likely to be charged with prostituting or loitering with intent to prostitute, as opposed to buying prostitution services. In regard to which racial demographic is more commonly charged with buying prostitution services, here, Hispanics made up 70.5% of CAPC 647(b)(2) charges, an enormous increase compared to their proportion of CAPC 647(b)(1) violations (19.3%) or their CAPC 653.22(a) violations (28.9%) as well their proportion of all 3,062 charges in the data set (35%). These significant racial discrepancies, depending upon whether a charge criminalizes individuals performing or soliciting sex work (CAPC 647(b)(1) and CAPC CAPC 653.22(a) charges) or whether it criminalizes individuals purchasing or seeking out prostitution services (CAPC 647(b)(2)) supports a similar finding found in the section on Gender. This has important implications when both sections are considered together, as will be discussed in a later section. </p>
<h4 id="e-case-filing-decision">E. Case Filing Decision:</h4>
<p>This next section will briefly examine the most common case filing decisions resulting from prostitution charges. There were six primary case filing decisions corresponding with each charge: misdemeanor filed- OR (own recognizance-released), misdemeanor filed- custody, misdemeanor filed- VA, misdemeanor filed- bail, misdemeanor rejected- other reason, misdemeanor rejected- lack of sufficient evidence and misdemeanor rejected-interest of justice. By the far the common decision was “misdemeanor filed- own recognizance” which constituted 61.7% of all case filing decision. The next most common decisions were “misdemeanor rejected-lack of evidence” at 15.5%, “misdemeanor filed-custody” at 8.9% and “misdemeanor rejected- interest of justice” at 4.8%, with the rest of the filing decisions constituting 3% or lower.</p>
<p>Case filing decisions generally did not significantly change when analyzing charges separately, with “misdemeanor filed-own recognizance” remaining the most common filing decision. However it is important to note that the numbers of misdemeanors that were rejected due to lack of sufficient evidence was significantly higher for CAPC 653.22 charges (criminalizes loitering for the purposes of prostitute oneself), where 28.4% of charges brought under this section were rejected due to lack of evidence, compared to 10% of CAPC 647(b)(1) violations, 8.5% of CAPC 647(b)(2) violations, and 15% of all prostitution charges. This higher rate of rejected misdemeanors due to lack of evidence for CAPC 653.22 charges, a charge which specifically requires a discernment of intent to prostitute based on behavior and circumstances, could suggest that this is a type of charge prone to selective and discriminatory enforcement based on its allowance of charges to be brought based on vague understanding of intent (discussed in the below section).<sup id="fnref:88"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:88">88</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="f-implicationstakeaways">F. Implications/Takeaways</h4>
<p>The first primary takeaway from the above analysis is that prostitution criminalization has a far greater disproportionate impact on African Americans than the criminalization of low level offenses in general, with African Americans making up 37.8% of all prostitution related charges yet only 23.2% of the entirety of the charges in the data set. However, more specifically, the criminalization of prostitution, and particularly the criminalization of the activities of sex workers themselves in Los Angeles has an extraordinary disproportionate impact on black women. In the analysis of gender, the data showed that while women made up 56.4% of all charges in their entirety, this number jumps to an extraordinary <em>89.7%,</em>when examining CAPC 647(b) violations (the most common type of charge) which charges prostitutes for soliciting or engaging in prostitution. Additionally, this number could be even higher depending on how the data categorizes the gender of trans women. Furthermore, the analysis of race indicated that 51.5% of the 3,190 CAPC 647(b)(1) charges were against African Americans, compared to 37.8% of the entire data set. These dual findings center racial and gender justice concerns at the heart of the discussion ofAngeles the negative consequences of prostitution criminalization</p>
<p>A second primary concern generated from this data set is that there is an immense potential for discriminatory and selective enforcement of prostitution charges. This type of concern is not isolated to Los Angeles, as past litigation in other jurisdictions have challenged vague loitering laws incentivizing discriminatory police enforcement against women of color and particularly trans women.<sup id="fnref:89"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:89">89</a></sup> Here, some of these charges, particularly CAPC 653.22 which criminalizes loitering with intent to commit prostitution, arguably provide law enforcement significant discretion in determining what loitering “with intent to prostitute” looks like. This concern is raised both by the statutory language itself, as well as the fact that African Americans made up 56.1% of this charge (higher than any other type of charge in the data set), which raises concerns that this charge is ripe for discriminatory enforcement against African Americans based on unconscious or conscious police officer bias or prejudice.</p>
<p>The language of CAPC 653.22 provides that “<em>it is unlawful for any person to loiter in any public place with the intent to commit prostitution. This intent is evidenced by acting in a manner and under circumstances that openly demonstrate the purpose of inducing, enticing, or soliciting prostitution, or procuring another to commit prostitution</em>.”<sup id="fnref:90"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:90">90</a></sup> Here, there is a strong argument to be made that “acting in a manner and under circumstances that openly demonstrate the purpose of inducing, enticing, or soliciting prostitutution” does not provide law enforcement enough guidance to properly enforce this charge, and incentivizes overly reliance on conscious or subconscious prejudice against people who look or dress a certain way. The statute does provide a list of factors which can be considered in determining such “intent”, including whether an individual repeatedly beckons, engages in conversation with someone, repeatedly stop or attempts to stop motor vehicles, has a past conviction for prostitution within the last five years, has engaged in this type of behavior within the last six months, and whether it is in an area “known for its prostitution activity.”<sup id="fnref:91"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:91">91</a></sup> Whereas these factors do appear to provide relatively tangible and concrete factors for officers to rely on, it is relevant to note that these factors are not exclusive, nor required, and importantly do not explicitly prohibit considerations of factors such as dress attire, a specific factor which has been litigated in the past based on its discriminatory application to trans women.<sup id="fnref:92"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:92">92</a></sup> Thus, while this statute does appear to provide law enforcement with some level of guidance, because of the potential for discriminatory enforcement and the fact that CAPC 653.22 charges are brought against African Americans at a proportionality higher than any other type of prostitution charge in the data set (56.1%), CAPC 653.22 should be considered to be a priority repeal, in terms of future decriminalization strategy and planning. </p>
<h2 id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The issue of policing of low-level offenses in Los Angeles has become a serious issue that local groups are working to address. This form of criminalization of low-level offenses serves to not only criminalize entire communities but also serves to create pipelines to carceral systems. The goal of this project and report is to bring light to this issue by using the data collected by Court Watch Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Police Department, and the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office to analyze the state of misdemeanor and low-level offense criminalization in Los Angeles. We strongly believe that greater attention must be brought to the myriad of issues that the criminalization of low-level offenses poses to the Los Angeles community.</p>

<p>Additional notes about Hispanic charging data – the disparity between MD rejected and MD filed are the smaller categories with lesser numbers, like MD filed- VA; MD filed – bail; Warrant, hearing.</p>
<p>Average imposed probation: 6.19; majority of the disposition was NULL.</p>

<p>Additional notes – see paper about the MD filed in VA and for a warrant. More interested in LAPD to CA data, and less about case disposition because many categories have a large percentage of “NULL.” </p>
<p>Need to determine what branch AC is. Much higher proportion when charge is 41.24.</p>

<p>This was calculated by dividing the population standard deviation by the mean. Its purpose is to determine the extent to which the prevalence of a charge category varies by district.
