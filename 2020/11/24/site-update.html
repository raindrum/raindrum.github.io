<hr>
<p>You might've noticed that this website looks totally different now!</p>
<p>That's because I'm constitutionally incapable of letting things be. I migrated the site from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to <a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/">Pelican</a>, a different static site generator that runs on Python instead of Ruby. I've been meaning to switch over, because I do a lot of coding in Python whereas Ruby is out of my wheelhouse. Now that my site is built on my usual language, it'll be easier for me to integrate it with some of my other projects.</p>
<p>Jargon aside, I also took the opportunity to build the site more or less from scratch, hence the new look. Before, I was using the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">Lanyon</a> theme. I still like it a lot, but the CSS was too complicated for me to feel comfortable tinkering with it. Now that I'm starting over, I can customize the look to better suit the content. For instance, take a look at the redesigned <a href="/lawsearch">Law Search</a> page!</p>
<p>But now it's time for me to take a step back from web design, and focus on studying for final exams.</p>
