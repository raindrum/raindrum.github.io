These are my organized notes from Suing The Police, a two-week class I took at UCLA Law in January 2020, with Professor Joanna Schwartz. I've tried to add hyperlinks to to various sources, so it might be helpful as a jumping-off point for research. Needless to say, **nothing here is legal advice.**

I'm hoping to post more of my notes from other classes to the site, but it may be a while.

## Introduction to § 1983

> **Every person who, under color of** any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of **any State** or Territory or the District of Columbia, **subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States** or other person within the jurisdiction thereof **to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law**, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer's judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable For the purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of Columbia.

[42 U.S.C. § 1983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) (emphasis added).

### Elements of the Cause of Action

Must prove each element by a preponderance of the evidence.

1.  conduct by a "person"
2.  who acted "under color of state law"
3.  proximately causing
4.  a deprivation of a federally protected right -- depending on the specific claim, this may require a certain state of mind
5.  (for municipal liability) and the deprivation was attributable to the enforcement of a municipal custom or policy

See [*Section 1983 Litigation* (Federal Judicial Center 2014)](https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2014/Section-1983-Litigation-3D-FJC-Schwartz-2014.pdf#page=24).

### Excessive Force (4th Amend.)

#### Threshold: Was the Force a "Seizure?"

The Supreme Court has articulated several standards, see [*Section 1983 Litigation* p.47](https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2014/Section-1983-Litigation-3D-FJC-Schwartz-2014.pdf#page=59):

-   Whether "the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen." [*Terry v. Ohio* n.16 (U.S. 1968)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17773604035873288886#[16]).

-   Whether, as a result of an official show of authority, a "reasonable person would have believed he was not free to leave," and the person in fact submitted to the assertion of authority." [*California v. Hodari D.* (U.S. 1991)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3128854250640310684#p628).

-   Whether there was "a governmental termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied." [*Brower v. Cty. of Inyo* (U.S. 1989)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1981267556172816296#p597) (use of roadblock to stop fleeing motorist was seizure; question is whether reasonable officer would have believed the means used would cause suspect to stop).

#### Standard: Was the Force Unreasonable?

##### *Graham* Standard

To determine reasonableness of force, courts must consider "the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including

-   the severity of the crime at issue,

-   whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and

-   whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.

The 'reasonableness' of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight." [*Graham v. Connor* (U.S. 1989)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4306215806680760770#p396).

##### Other Notes

-   The giving of a warning or the failure to do so is a factor to be considered in applying the Graham balancing test. [*Nelson v. City of Davis* (9th Cir. 2012)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8601829810227944788).

-   "It is rarely necessary, if ever, for a police officer to employ substantial force without warning against an individual who is suspected only of minor offenses, is not resisting arrest, and, most important, does not pose any apparent threat to officer or public safety. [*Young v. Cty. of L.A.* (9th Cir. 2011)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7244655697929059531#p1166).

-   [*Nehad v. Browder* (9th Cir. 2019)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11847472060327272746#p1136) ("Even if Nehad had made felonious threats or committed a serious crime prior to Browder's arrival, he was indisputably not engaged in any such conduct when Browder arrived, let alone when Browder fired his weapon.")

- The use of deadly force is reasonable only if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a risk of serious harm to the officer or others. [*Tennessee v. Garner* (U.S. 1985)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5843997099226288287) (finding it unreasonable to shoot a fleeing burglary suspect. This is not a special rule, just an application of the Fourth Amendment reasonableness standard. [*Scott v. Harris* (U.S. 2007)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18309800007705573319).

### False Arrest (4th Amend.)

Different standards apply to arrests versus stops and frisks:

#### Arrests

See [*Section 1983 Litigation* p.60](https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2014/Section-1983-Litigation-3D-FJC-Schwartz-2014.pdf#page=60):

-   For unconstitutional arrests, key issue is whether the officer had **probable cause**.

-   Warrantless arrest in a public place needs some probable cause, but it need not be probable cause for the specific crime articulated by the arresting officer; it can even be probable cause for a crime that only authorizes a citation.

-   Arrests at the arrestee's home typically need an arrest warrant and reason to believe the suspect is in the home.

#### Stops and Frisks

-   Only need **reasonable suspicion**. The officer must "point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inference from those facts, reasonably warrant \[the\] intrusion." [*Terry v. Ohio* (U.S. 1968)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17773604035873288886).

### Substantive Due Process

Substantive due process protects individuals who have been subject to excessive force in a *nonseizure, nonprisoner* context because neither the 4th nor 8th Amendment apply in. See [*Section 1983 Litigation* p.39](https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2014/Section-1983-Litigation-3D-FJC-Schwartz-2014.pdf#page=60):

Substantive due process standards depend on whether challenged action is legislative, executive w/ time to deliberate, or executive w/o time to deliberate. [*Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis* (U.S. 1998)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=974067119695457053).

- **Legislative** action violates due process if not reasonably related to a legitimate government interest (or fails a higher standard)
- **Executive** action violates due process if it "shocks the conscience"
  - if there was time to deliberate, it shocks the conscience if "deliberately indifferent"
  - if no time to deliberate, shocks the conscience only if D acted **with a purpose to harm that is unrelated to a legitimate law enforcement interest.** E.g. *id.* (high-speed chase did not shock the conscience)

## Damages

### Damages Generally

- Section 1983 created a form of tort liability. Punitive damages aside, damages in tort cases are designed to provide compensation for the plaintiff's injuries, and may include out-of-pocket and other economic losses, as well as impairment of reputation, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering. [*Memphis v. Stachura* (U.S. 1986)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8530617719090532710#p307).

- If the plaintiff has established a constitutional violation but cannot prove damages, nominal damages of \$1 are appropriate.

- Abstract value of the constitutional right may not form the basis for § 1983 damages. See *Stachura* (where teacher was suspended in violation of 1st Amendment, Court rejected specific category of damages for importance of 1st Amendment)

- For an overview of the doctrine, as well as some representative awards in different types of Section 1983 cases, see *Police Misconduct: Defense Strategies: Damages and Attorneys' Fees* (Wayne C. Beyer)

### Punitive Damages

- Punitive damages cannot be awarded against municipalities or individuals acting in their official capacity. [*Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.* (U.S. 1981)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16519529329572741693).

### Deterrent Effect of Damages?

- Government entities don't react rationally to damages because they respond to political, not economic, pressures. [*Making Government Pay: Markets, Politics, and the Allocation of Constitutional Costs* (Daryl J. Levinson 2000)](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5060&context=uclrev)

- But municipal liability claims serve a 'fault-fixing' function that can overcome the 'one bad apple' excuse, and we would do well to expand it. [*In Defense of Making Government Pay: The Deterrent Effect of Constitutional Tort Remedies* (Myriam E. Gilles 2000) ](https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/geolr35&div=30)

- Police officers themselves pay virtually none of the damages judgments awarded against them, including punitive damages, even when indemnification is prohibited by law or policy. [*Police Indemnification* (Joanna Schwartz 2014)](https://escholarship.org/content/qt8t1934f6/qt8t1934f6.pdf) (studying 44 of the largest jurisdictions between 2006 and 2011)

- Only about half of law enforcement agencies financially contribute *in some manner* to paying lawsuits against them. And some of these departments have budgets that insulate them from the actual consequences, because the municipality irrevocably budgets for the suits. However, in smaller jurisdictions that rely on outside liability insurers, such insurers sometimes pressure departments to adopt reforms, and pose an existential threat if they don't. [*How Governments Pay: Lawsuits, Budgets, and Police Reform* (Joanna Schwartz 2016)](https://www.uclalawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Schwartz-FP-1-How-Governments-Pay.pdf)

- Police departments rarely pay attention to lawsuits alleging officer misconduct. [*Myths and Mechanics of Deterrence: The Role of Lawsuits in Enforcement Decisionmaking* (Joanna Schwartz 2010)](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=888113013007027117118114009098019094032059000085054054113127081097111080097124123075026050063104107058097103095070011025024119058039008069063020028103121095004079055079001105010066005088126122083007120089115020074093076025126120001104094024114100007&EXT=pdf)

## Injunctive Relief

### Private Cause of Action under § 1983

#### Standing Requirements

-   To seek injunctive relief under § 1983, a plaintiff must show both (1) a likelihood of future harm, and (2) the existence of an official policy or its equivalent. [*Los Angeles v. Lyons* (U.S. 1983)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4587981977816900853#p105) (denying injunctive relief to man subjected to unconstitutional, unprovoked chokehold by LAPD during vehicle stop)

-   In class action lawsuits, "unless the named plaintiffs are themselves entitled to seek injunctive relief, they may not represent a class seeking that relief." [*Hodgers-Durgin v. De La Vina* (9th Cir. 1999)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10993164981183849619#p1045) (where named plaintiffs were unconstitutionally stopped by Border Patrol only once despite driving same stretch of road regularly for years, they did not satisfy *Lyons*)

##### Proving Likelihood of Future Injury

-   Easy to prove in suits against jail conditions, because of regular interaction.

-   It helps if plaintiffs need not break the law to experience the injury.

-   Helps to construe the harm broadly. See e.g. [*Meister v. City of Hawthorne* (C.D. Cal. 2014)](https://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/cacdce/2:2014cv01096/582771) ("Plaintiffs allege that a statutory violation occurs upon every interaction between the HPD and its hearing-impaired residents, who are allegedly denied the benefits of HPD services because of their disability. The injury alleged is not speculative or contingent, but instead is exceedingly likely to afflict Meister and the other hearing-impaired residents of Hawthorne in the future.")

-   It helps when the harm results from an unconstitutional policy, and when plaintiffs have experienced the harm multiple times. See e.g., [*Nat'l Congress PR Rights v. City of New York* (S.D.N.Y. 1999)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17839907099983072677#p161) (in stop-and-frisk class action, both these factors distinguished the case from *Lyons*)

##### Proving Official Policy or its Equivalent

-   See *Monell* claims, infra.

-   In *An v. City of New York*, plaintiff alleged First Amendment violation for arrest while filming police, but case was was dismissed for failure to show policy. Plaintiff amended complaint to add more examples of conduct, and case eventually settled with promise of training.

#### Prison Reform In NYC

See [*Excessive Force in the New York City Jails: Litigation and its Lessons* (John Boston 2006)](https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://duckduckgo.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1351&context=law_journal_law_policy), describing the New York City Legal Aid Society's slow, but generally positive results in reforming NYC prisons prison through 20 years of litigation.

-   Brought class-action suit [*Sheppard v. Phoenix* (S.D.N.Y. 2002)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8623335185089102413) on behalf of prisoners at Rikers' segregation unit; entered consent judgment the eve of the trial, requiring change in use of force policies, supervision, staff discipline, installation of video cameras, etc. Four years of judicial supervision aided by expert consultants, terminated successfully. See [Boston p.163-65](https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://duckduckgo.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1351&context=law_journal_law_policy#page=10) (describing the process).

-   But the Dept of Corrections didn't extend the reforms outside the (court-required) segregation unit changes. Abuses persisted elsewhere, so plaintiffs brought [*Ingles v. Toro*, (S.D.N.Y. 2006)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2183692890702155990) challenging abuses at other prisons and in Rikers. Entered private settlement agreement mandating cameras, changes to use-of-force policy, training and recruiting, force tacking system, etc. The settlement approval order noted with concern that private settlement agreement means enforcing compliance would require a new trial in state court with a new, unfamiliar judge.

### Department of Justice Suit under § 14141

42 U.S.C. § 14141 lets attorney general initiate structural reform litigation against police depts with pattern or practice of unconstitutional misconduct.

-   DoJ puts much time and resources into investigation, which then typically leads to a settlement with little judicial involvement.

-   *Lyons* standing requirements don't apply to DoJ.

-   Obama admin used this power much more than Bush admin or Trump admin (which says it won't use the power at all).

-   DoJ has the leverage and (depending on the president) the motivation, but doesn't have the resources to pursue many of these cases. See [*Who Can Police the Police* p.446-48 (Joanna Schwartz 2016)](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1573&context=uclf#page=11).

#### Competing Case Studies in LAPD and ACSD

See [Stephen Rushin, *Competing Case Studies of Structural Reform Litigation in American Police Departments*](https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/handle/1811/79757/1/OSJCL_V14N1_113.pdf) (comparing generally favorable results in reforming LAPD over 12 years, where leadership was cooperative, with unfavorable results in suing small, racist Alamance County Sheriff's Department, which revealed the DoJ's potential weakness when these suits are actually contested)

-   See [U.S. v. Los Angeles Consent Decree](./Day%203%20(Injunctive%20Relief)/Injunctive%20Relief%20and%20Reform/US%20v.%20Los%20Angeles%20%20Consent%20Decree.pdf) (mandating many detailed changes to LAPD infrastructure and policies)

-   Rushin says LAPD consent decree was successful; people's opinions of LAPD went up, and use of force went down (though went back up after auditing stopped), even though overall street-level policing increased. But it took 12 years and there was considerable organizational buy-in.

-   In Alamance, district judge rejected DoJ's case as resting on sheriff's statements and unpersuasive statistics about biased policing. Judge ignored troubling practices, like seeking info on immigration status of people not in custody, and firing officers who spoke out.

### How Injunctions Operate

Court retains jurisdiction over the case, and can exert at least 3 levels of pressure:

1.  The court-appointed monitor ensures the defendant feels watched.

2.  The judge can extend the oversight period. See [Rushin](https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/handle/1811/79757/1/OSJCL_V14N1_113.pdf), noting the 12-year length of supervising LAPD.

3.  Court can enter sanctions or hold the defendant in contempt. It's rare, and requires essentially a whole new trial.

It can be helpful to build community oversight requirements into a consent decree. The requirements will eventually expire, but there will hopefully be political costs to abolishing the oversight.

There's a different between consent decrees and private settlements. See [*Ingles v. Toro* (S.D.N.Y. 2006)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2183692890702155990#p215).

## Class Actions

Class actions are governed by [FRCP 23](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23).

### Standards for a Class

Must meet all prerequisites in Rule 23(a), *and* satisfy the requirements of one of the three types of class actions under Rule 23(b).

#### Rule 23(a)—Prerequisites.

One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members only if:

##### (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;

Courts generally find numerosity satisfied when class is 40 or more members. See, e.g., [*Floyd v. City of New York* (S.D.N.Y. 2012)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2647873809664857644#r[118]) (2nd Circuit presumes numerosity at level of 40 members)

Numerosity requirement is generally *not* satisfied with a class of 21 or fewer. E.g. [*MacNamara v. City of New York* (S.D.N.Y. 2011)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=478544296274589326#:~:text=not%20satisfied%20when%20the%20class%20comprises%2021or%20fewer).

Between 22 and 39 members, it's a "gray area" where court should consider additional factors besides class size, *see id.* at 137-38*.* These include:

-   the judicial economy of avoiding multiple suits

-   the geographic dispersion of the proposed class members

-   the financial resources of the proposed class members

-   the ability of the proposed class embers to file individual suits

-   requests for prospective injunctive relief which would involve future class members.

##### (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;

-   generally must show the whole class suffered the same harm.

-   Plaintiffs' claims "must depend on a common contention" which "must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution---which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke." [*Wal-Mart v. Dukes* (U.S. 2011)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18268052394732696129#p2551) (finding female Wal-Mart employees nationwide did not allege commonality based on policy of allowing subjective decisions by sexist managers)

-   But see, e.g., [*Floyd v. City of New York* (S.D.N.Y. 2012)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2647873809664857644#r[122]) (distinguishing *Wal-Mart* because despite officers' discretion in who to frisk, they were implementing a centralized stop-and-frisk policy.

- See generally [*MacNamara v. City of New York* (S.D.N.Y. 2011)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=478544296274589326) (assessing commonality individually for each of three subclasses: mass arrest, excessive detention, and confinement conditions).

##### (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and

-   related to commonality requirement, often overlaps

##### (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.

-   must have no fundamental conflict of interest

-   lawyer must be adequate

#### Rule 23(b)—Types of Class Actions.

Must satisfy one of the following, as well as Rule 23(a):

##### Joint, Common, or Secondary Right

Requires that "prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; or (B) adjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests." Rule 23(b)(1).

- not generally relevant in § 1983.

- This clause is illustrated in actions brought by or against representatives of an unincorporated association. [ACN to Rule 23](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23).

##### Classwide Injunctive or Declaratory Relief Appropriate

Requires that "the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole." Rule 23(b)(2).

- "When a class seeks an indivisible injunction benefitting all its members at once, there is no reason to undertake a case-specific inquiry into whether class issues predominate or whether class action is a superior method of adjudicating the dispute." [*Wal-Mart v. Dukes* (U.S. 2011)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18268052394732696129#p2557) (suggesting that Rule 23(b)(2) may be inappropriate *whenever* damages are sought).

- See [*MacNamara v. City of New York* (S.D.N.Y. 2011)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=478544296274589326) (declining to certify under Rule 23(b)(2) because class-wide relief was not appropriate respecting the class as a whole, for lack of likely future harm under *Lyons*, despite declarations by named and unnamed class members alleging plans to attend NYC protests in the future)

- But see [*Floyd v. City of New York* (S.D.N.Y. 2012)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2647873809664857644#r[159]) (certifying under 23(b)(2) based on centralized stop-and-frisk policy applicable to class of past and future victims of stop-and-frisk)

##### Predominately Common Questions of Law or Fact

Requires that "the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, **and** that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings include:

(A) the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;

(B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already

(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and

(D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action."

Rule 23(b)(3).

- See [*MacNamara v. City of New York* (S.D.N.Y. 2011)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=478544296274589326) (certifying each of three subclasses under this rule)

- In these cases, "the court must direct to class members the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice too all members who can be identified through reasonable effort. [Rule 23(c)(2)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23).

- Some courts apply an 'ascertainability' requirement, must know in advance who is a member of the class.

### Class Action Settlements

A class action lawsuit may only be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised wit the court's approval. [Rule 23(e)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23).

FRCP 23(e)(2): If the settlement would bind class members, the court must conduct a hearing to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate after considering whether

-   \(A) the class representatives and class counsel have adequately represented the class;

-   \(B) the proposal was negotiated at arm's length;

- \(C) the relief provided for the class is adequate, taking into account:

    -   \(i) the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal,

    -   \(ii) the effectiveness of any proposed method of distributing relief to the class, includng ithe method of processing class-member claims;

    -   \(iii) the terms of any proposed award of attorney's fees, including timing of payment; and

    -   \(iv) any agreement required to be identified under Rule 23(e)(3); and

- \(D) the proposal treats class members equitably relative to each other.

See [*Ingles v. Toro* (S.D.N.Y. 2006)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2183692890702155990#p212) (applying multi-factor fairness test to fairness of NYC prison settlement.)

### Notes about Class Actions

- Broader discovery is generally allowed in class action suits

- Can be helpful as an organizing/media tool, and legitimize the case

- Can be helpful where the individual harm is small?

- Classes suffering unconstitutional conduct often disagree about what should be done about it. See [Deborah L. Rhode, *Class Conflicts in Class Actions*](http://www.jstor.com/stable/1228362) (using school desegregation as example)

## Qualified Immunity

Qualified Immunity was invented by the Supreme Court in *Pierson v. Ray*, 386 U.S. 547 (1967), on the theory that Congress intended to incorporate a common-law good faith defense to false arrest.

Now, qualified immunity protects government officials "from liability for civil damages **insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights** of which a reasonable person would have known." [*Harlow v. Fitzgerald* (U.S. 1982)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13486920831186038844#p818).

#### Applicability

- Qualified Immunity applies only to claims against individuals for money damages. No QI for municipalities or injunctive relief.

- Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense, and defendants most often raise it at the summary judgment stage.

- Some courts have denied immunity to private actors. Supreme court has denied qualified immunity to private prison guard. But see [*Filarski v. Delia* (U.S. 2012)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14879912485048572533) (allowing QI for private investigator?). Seems to depend on existence of liability insurance, the type of work, and the relationship to the government.

#### How Well-Established must the Law Be?

##### Supreme Court Standards

- A clearly established right is one that is "sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right." [*Reichle v. Howards* (U.S. 2012)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11818225453453399091#p2093).

- "We do not require a case directly on point, but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate." [*Ashcroft v. al-Kidd* (U.S. 2011)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7219970976227790018#p2083).

- Clearly established law should not be defined "at a high level of generality." [*Id.*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7219970976227790018#p2084)

- But "officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances." [*Hope v. Pelzer* (U.S. 2002)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14064098720260954203#p741)

- See [*Mullenix v. Luna* (U.S. 2015)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4257407761799134776), finding the principle that a police officer may not "use deadly force against a fleeing felon who does not pose a sufficient threat of harm to the officer or others" did was too broad to clearly establish unconstitutionality of sniping possibly-drunk driver in car chase, against orders, when driver posed no imminent threat to drivers and was about to be stopped via spike strips.

- See also [*White v. Pauly* (U.S. 2017)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=163228777131001756#p551), finding it not clearly established that "since the Paulys could not have shot \[the officer] unless he moved from his position behind a stone wall, he could not have used deadly force without first warning Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon."

##### 9th Circuit

- "When the defendant's conduct is so patently violative of the constitutional right that reasonable officials would know without guidance from the courts' that the action was unconstitutional, closely analogous pre-existing case law is not required to show that the law is clearly established." [*Deorle v. Rutherford* (9th Cir. 2001)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6959922442571087110#p1286)

- Contact-tasing pregnant speeder who resisted only by refusing to sign ticket or leave car was a constitutional violation, but was not clearly established in 2004, because the cases addressing taser excessive force (in other circuits) were mixed and inapposite. Meanwhile, no cases had yet addressed the use of a taser in dart mode, so no clearly-established violation in tasing minimally-resistant woman in potentially-dangerous domestic dispute call without warning, who was not culpable for escalating situation. [*Mattos v. Agarano* (9th Cir. 2011)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8885904576580041534) (nevertheless finding each use of force a constitutional violation)

- It was clearly established in 2001 that mere passive resistance does not justify the application of nontrivial force, and in 2008 that using a taser in dart-mode was a nontrivial level of force. [*Gravelet-Blondin v. Shelton* (9th Cir. 2013)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7164141979577007607#r[10]) (denying summary judgment to cop who tased suicidal person's neighbor who came out to ask what police were doing to him, and who froze for 15 seconds when told to step back)

#### What Clearly Establishes Law?

Petitioners can show a clearly established right through "cases of controlling authority in their jurisdiction at the time of the incident" or through a "consensus of cases of persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer could not have believed that his actions were lawful." See [*Wilson v. Layne* (U.S. 1999)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7779618928446537859#p617).

- "Absent binding precedent, we look to all available decisional law, including the law of other circuits and district courts, to determine whether \[a\] right was clearly established." [*Inouye v. Kemna* (9th Cir. 2007)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6773570865128492755#p714); see also [*Gravelet-Blondin*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7164141979577007607#p1095) (quoting same).

- But the Supreme Court has been dropping hints that even circuit courts can't clearly establish the law.See, e.g., [*Carroll v. Carman* (U.S. 2014)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4252877984811775853#p350) ("Assuming for the sake of argument that a controlling circuit precedent could constitute clearly established federal law in these circumstances...")

## Municipal and Supervisory Liability

### Municipal Liability

A municipality may only be held liable under § 1983 when its "policy or custom" results in a constitutional injury to the plaintiff; respondeat superior liability is not available. See [*Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs.* (U.S. 1978)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2958398500325696309).

- Qualified immunity is not applicable to municipalities.

- Municipalities may not be subject to punitive damages. [*Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.* (U.S. 1981)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16519529329572741693).

#### What constitutes a "policy or custom?"

Generally, there's three ways to prove a *Monell* claim:

##### 1. Official Policy

- A municipality's official policy can be a basis for § 1983 liability. See [*Monell*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2958398500325696309)(department had unconstitutional policy of requiring pregnant employees to take maternity leave early)

- This is the rarest case, but the easiest to prove when it happens.

##### 2. A Decision by a Person with Final Policy-Making Authority

- Who the final policy maker is is a question of law.

- Where it's based on the decision of a subordinate, the final policy maker must approve the decision as well as the basis for it. There was a case that found no municipal liability where final policymaker essentially just said, "I trust your judgment." Citation needed.

##### 3. A Custom or Practice

This is the most common type of *Monell* claim, and includes claims premised on failure to train, discipline, supervise, or screen.

- Must show high 'deliberate indifference' standard.

- A municipality can be liable under § 1983 for failure to train if the need for training is "obvious," e.g. the need to give police use-of-force training before sending them out with guns, charged with suspects. [*City of Canton v. Harris* (U.S. 1989)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1913790172308662115).

- But a pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees is "ordinarily necessary" to demonstrate deliberate indifference for purposes of failure to train. [*Connick v. Thompson* (U.S. 2011)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16887528200611439212) (finding no obvious need to provide prosecutors *Brady* training, because fair to assume lawyers would know or be able to look it up)

- [*McKay v. City of Hayward* (N.D. Cal. 2013)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9672610414412185349#p985) denied summary judgment on plaintiff's three *Monell* claims
    1. that Hayward has an unconstitutional policy of allowing its officers to deploy police dogs "in circumstances where innocent third parties or bystanders may be in harm's way";
    2. that Hayward failed to properly train, supervise, and control police officers regarding the proper use of the dogs, and
    3. that Hayward failed to discipline officers for improperly using its police dogs, thereby ratifying unconstitutional behavior."

- But [*Johnson v. City of Vallejo* (E.D. Cal. 2015)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8466937423256216934#p1222)granted summary judgment against a failure-to-train claim premised on unaddressed uptick in police shootings, absent evidence that other shootings were actually unconstitutional.

#### Thoughts on Municipal Liability

- In one judge's experience, most *Monell* claims are brought so as to find a deep pocket, avoid juries' unwillingness to award substantial damages against individuals, and expand the scope of admissible evidence. But indemnification, issue preclusion, and bifurcated trials frustrate these goals and make many *Monell* claims a waste of time. See [*The Importance and Overuse of Policy and Custom Claims: A View From One Trench* (David F. Hamilton 1999)](https://via.library.depaul.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1700&context=law-review)

- But *Monell* claims are still helpful where qualified immunity is likely to go to the jury (?), where indemnification is unavailable, and where the harm results from a municipality's budgeting decisions. *Id.*

- "\[T\]he current practice of bifurcation virtually ensures that potentially meritorious *Monell* claims will die on the vine, because an award of compensatory damages against an individual officer makes the plaintiff whole, and there is nothing left to pursue against the municipality." [*In Defense of Making Government Pay* (Myriam E. Gilles 2001)](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/geolr35&i=861) (arguing that this should be alleviated by allowing punitive damages against municipalities)

- *Monell* claims are typically necessary for bringing a class action suit or an injunction about policy.

- Qualified immunity does not apply to municipalities

### Supervisory Liability

Before *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, a supervisory liability claim generally required showing two things:
1. that the supervisory defendant either acquiesced in or was deliberately indifferent to the subordinate's unconstitutional conduct; and
2. that the supervisor's action or inaction was "affirmatively linked" to the deprivation of the plaintiff's federal rights." [*Section 1983 Litigation* p.115](https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2014/Section-1983-Litigation-3D-FJC-Schwartz-2014.pdf#page=127).

But now "\[I\]n a § 1983 suit or a *Bivens* action—where masters do not answer for the torts of their servants—the term 'supervisory liability' is a misnomer. Absent vicarious liability, each Government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct. In the context of determining whether there is a violation of a clearly established right to overcome qualified immunity, **purpose rather than knowledge is required to impose** *Bivens* **liability on the subordinate** for unconstitutional discrimination; **the same holds true for an official charged with violations arising from his or her superintendent responsibilities.**" [*Ashcroft v. Iqbal* (U.S. 2009)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16725752296468120395)

- Supervisory liability claims used to be common.

- No single standard has emerged since *Iqbal*; some circuits have taken it to mean that the supervisor's required level of culpability shifts based on the underlying violation, whereas others have just raised the standard more vaguely. See [Patrick Boynton, *Supervisory Liability in the Circuit Courts After Iqbal* (Patrick Boynton 2018)](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1683&context=jcl); see also [*Section 1983 Litigation* n.1028](https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2014/Section-1983-Litigation-3D-FJC-Schwartz-2014.pdf#page=267) (summarizing various circuits' approaches).

- See, e.g, [*Starr v. Baca* (9th Cir. 2011)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14724931660014683231) (finding the supervisor needs the mental state, e.g. deliberate indiffernce, required for direct individual liability for the constitutional violation)

- See [*Johnson v. City of Vallejo* (E.D. Cal. 2015)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8466937423256216934#p1219) (considering and rejecting supervisory liability claim alongside municipal liability, for lack of deliberate indifference as well as causal connection)

- punitive damages are available against supervisors

- Qualified immunity protects supervisors

## Attorneys' Fees

"In any action or proceeding to enforce \[§ 1983, among others\], the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs ..." [42 U.S.C. § 1988(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1988).

- Previously, 'prevailing party' just meant catalyzing the desired change. Now, a party must secure a judgment on the merits or a settlement agreement that is enforced through a consent decree. [*Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. W.V. Dept. of Health and Human Resources* (U.S. 2001).](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18016879269718488474)

- "The most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate." [*Hensley v. Eckerhart* (U.S. 1983)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5179727217217722884).

- Where the plaintiff fails to prevail on a claim, the hours spent on it should be excluded from calculation if the claim is unrelated to the plaintiff's successful claims. [*Id.*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5179727217217722884#p440)

- Although the amount of damages awarded "is one of many factors that a court should consider in calculating an award of attorney's fees" under § 1988, there is no requirement that an award of attorneys' fees be proportional to the damages awarded to the plaintiff. [*Riverside v. Rivera* (U.S. 1986)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8789673379809042125#r[17]) (emphasizing § 1988's purpose to encourage bringing suits that benefit the public and validate important rights)

- Attorney fee motions and rulings are full of nitpicking. See, e.g., *Jones v. Cty. of Sacramento*, No. CIV S-09-1025 DAD (E.D. Cal. 2011) (devoting a paragraph to 0.1 hours of telephone conversation); see also *Perrin v. Goodrich*, No. ED CV 08-00595 LLP (SSx) (E.D. Cal. 2012) (defendants argued that plaintiff's fees should be reduced 25% for half-hour block billing, but presence of some half-hour and hour-long intervals was probably coincidence)

- Declarations from fellow attorneys in the field, e.g. Carol Sobel, are very helpful in getting fee awards.

- For tips on recovering fees, and implicit criticism of the doctrine as unfair to plaintiffs, see *Paying for Justice: The Recovery of Attorneys Fees Under Section 1988* (Hiram Sasser 2009)

#### Fees and Settlements

Plaintiffs can waive attorneys' fees in settlements, including class-action settlements. See [*Evans v. Jeff D.* (U.S. 1986)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17948293160115901520).

- See [*Requiem for Section 1983* p.19 (Paul D. Reingold 2008)](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1331&context=articles#page=20), arguing:
  1. that fee-shifting only affects the market for plaintiffs with good-liability/bad-damages cases; and
  2. that an *Evans* offer can usually be effective as a defense negotiation strategy only in good-liability/bad-damages cases. What *Evans* does, then, is to reverse the rationale for fee-shifting.

## Regional Variation

Areas vary wildly in their hospitality to civil rights claims, based on "actors (including plaintiffs' attorneys, state and federal judges, state and federal juries, and defense counsel), legal rules and remedies (including state tort law, Section 1983 doctrine and defenses, and damages caps), and informal practices (which can include litigation, settlement, and indemnification decisions)." [*Civil Rights Ecosystems* (Joanna Schwartz 2020)](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6085&context=mlr)

California state civil rights laws, especially the Bane Act, can be very helpful supplements (or alternatives) to federal Section 1983 claims.
