<p>These are my organized notes from Suing The Police, a two-week class I took at <span class="caps">UCLA</span> Law in January 2020, with Professor Joanna Schwartz. I&#8217;m hoping to post more of my notes from other classes to the site, but it may be a&nbsp;while.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-1983">Introduction to §&nbsp;1983</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Every person who, under color of</strong> any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of <strong>any State</strong> or Territory or the District of Columbia, <strong>subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States</strong> or other person within the jurisdiction thereof <strong>to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law</strong>, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer&#8217;s judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable For the purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of&nbsp;Columbia.</p>

<h4 id="threshold-was-the-force-a-seizure">Threshold: Was the Force a&nbsp;&#8220;Seizure?&#8221;</h4>
<p>The Supreme Court has articulated several standards, see <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2014/Section-1983-Litigation-3D-FJC-Schwartz-2014.pdf#page=59"><em>Section 1983 Litigation</em> p.47</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whether &#8220;the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen.&#8221; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17773604035873288886#[16]"><em>Terry v. Ohio</em> n.16 (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1968)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether, as a result of an official show of authority, a &#8220;reasonable person would have believed he was not free to leave,&#8221; and the person in fact submitted to the assertion of authority.&#8221; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3128854250640310684#p628"><em>California v. Hodari D.</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1991)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether there was &#8220;a governmental termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.&#8221; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1981267556172816296#p597"><em>Brower v. Cty. of Inyo</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1989)</a> (use of roadblock to stop fleeing motorist was seizure; question is whether reasonable officer would have believed the means used would cause suspect to&nbsp;stop).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="standard-was-the-force-unreasonable">Standard: Was the Force&nbsp;Unreasonable?</h4>
<h5 id="graham-standard"><em>Graham</em>&nbsp;Standard</h5>
<p>To determine reasonableness of force, courts must consider &#8220;the facts and circumstances of each particular case,&nbsp;including</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the severity of the crime at&nbsp;issue,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,&nbsp;and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by&nbsp;flight.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The &#8216;reasonableness&#8217; of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.&#8221; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4306215806680760770#p396"><em>Graham v. Connor</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1989)</a>.</p>
<h5 id="other-notes">Other&nbsp;Notes</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The giving of a warning or the failure to do so is a factor to be considered in applying the Graham balancing test. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8601829810227944788"><em>Nelson v. City of Davis</em> (9th Cir. 2012)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It is rarely necessary, if ever, for a police officer to employ substantial force without warning against an individual who is suspected only of minor offenses, is not resisting arrest, and, most important, does not pose any apparent threat to officer or public safety. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7244655697929059531#p1166"><em>Young v. Cty. of <span class="caps">L.A.</span></em> (9th Cir. 2011)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11847472060327272746#p1136"><em>Nehad v. Browder</em> (9th Cir. 2019)</a> (&#8220;Even if Nehad had made felonious threats or committed a serious crime prior to Browder&#8217;s arrival, he was indisputably not engaged in any such conduct when Browder arrived, let alone when Browder fired his&nbsp;weapon.&#8221;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of deadly force is reasonable only if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a risk of serious harm to the officer or others. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5843997099226288287"><em>Tennessee v. Garner</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1985)</a> (finding it unreasonable to shoot a fleeing burglary suspect. This is not a special rule, just an application of the Fourth Amendment reasonableness standard. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18309800007705573319"><em>Scott v. Harris</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 2007)</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="false-arrest-4th-amend">False Arrest (4th&nbsp;Amend.)</h3>
<p>Different standards apply to arrests versus stops and&nbsp;frisks:</p>
<h4 id="arrests">Arrests</h4>
<p>See <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2014/Section-1983-Litigation-3D-FJC-Schwartz-2014.pdf#page=60"><em>Section 1983 Litigation</em> p.60</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For unconstitutional arrests, key issue is whether the officer had <strong>probable cause</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warrantless arrest in a public place needs some probable cause, but it need not be probable cause for the specific crime articulated by the arresting officer; it can even be probable cause for a crime that only authorizes a&nbsp;citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrests at the arrestee&#8217;s home typically need an arrest warrant and reason to believe the suspect is in the&nbsp;home.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="stops-and-frisks">Stops and&nbsp;Frisks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only need <strong>reasonable suspicion</strong>. The officer must &#8220;point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inference from those facts, reasonably warrant [the] intrusion.&#8221; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17773604035873288886"><em>Terry v. Ohio</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1968)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="substantive-due-process">Substantive Due&nbsp;Process</h3>
<p>Substantive due process protects individuals who have been subject to excessive force in a <em>nonseizure, nonprisoner</em> context because neither the 4th nor 8th Amendment apply in. See <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2014/Section-1983-Litigation-3D-FJC-Schwartz-2014.pdf#page=60"><em>Section 1983 Litigation</em> p.39</a>:</p>
<p>Substantive due process standards depend on whether challenged action is legislative, executive w/ time to deliberate, or executive w/o time to deliberate. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=974067119695457053"><em>Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1998)</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legislative</strong> action violates due process if not reasonably related to a legitimate government interest (or fails a higher&nbsp;standard)</li>
<li><strong>Executive</strong> action violates due process if it &#8220;shocks the&nbsp;conscience&#8221;</li>
<li>if there was time to deliberate, it shocks the conscience if &#8220;deliberately&nbsp;indifferent&#8221;</li>
<li>if no time to deliberate, shocks the conscience only if D acted <strong>with a purpose to harm that is unrelated to a legitimate law enforcement interest.</strong> E.g. <em>id.</em> (high-speed chase did not shock the&nbsp;conscience)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="damages">Damages</h2>
<h3 id="damages-generally">Damages&nbsp;Generally</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Section 1983 created a form of tort liability. Punitive damages aside, damages in tort cases are designed to provide compensation for the plaintiff&#8217;s injuries, and may include out-of-pocket and other economic losses, as well as impairment of reputation, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8530617719090532710#p307"><em>Memphis v. Stachura</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1986)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the plaintiff has established a constitutional violation but cannot prove damages, nominal damages of \$1 are&nbsp;appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstract value of the constitutional right may not form the basis for § 1983 damages. See <em>Stachura</em> (where teacher was suspended in violation of 1st Amendment, Court rejected specific category of damages for importance of 1st&nbsp;Amendment)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an overview of the doctrine, as well as some representative awards in different types of Section 1983 cases, see <em>Police Misconduct: Defense Strategies: Damages and Attorneys&#8217; Fees</em> (Wayne C.&nbsp;Beyer)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="punitive-damages">Punitive&nbsp;Damages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Punitive damages cannot be awarded against municipalities or individuals acting in their official capacity. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16519529329572741693"><em>Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1981)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deterrent-effect-of-damages">Deterrent Effect of&nbsp;Damages?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Government entities don&#8217;t react rationally to damages because they respond to political, not economic, pressures. <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5060&amp;context=uclrev"><em>Making Government Pay: Markets, Politics, and the Allocation of Constitutional Costs</em> (Daryl J. Levinson&nbsp;2000)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But municipal liability claims serve a &#8216;fault-fixing&#8217; function that can overcome the &#8216;one bad apple&#8217; excuse, and we would do well to expand it. <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/geolr35&amp;div=30"><em>In Defense of Making Government Pay: The Deterrent Effect of Constitutional Tort Remedies</em> (Myriam E. Gilles&nbsp;2000) </a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Police officers themselves pay virtually none of the damages judgments awarded against them, including punitive damages, even when indemnification is prohibited by law or policy. <a href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt8t1934f6/qt8t1934f6.pdf"><em>Police Indemnification</em> (Joanna Schwartz 2014)</a> (studying 44 of the largest jurisdictions between 2006 and&nbsp;2011)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only about half of law enforcement agencies financially contribute <em>in some manner</em> to paying lawsuits against them. And some of these departments have budgets that insulate them from the actual consequences, because the municipality irrevocably budgets for the suits. However, in smaller jurisdictions that rely on outside liability insurers, such insurers sometimes pressure departments to adopt reforms, and pose an existential threat if they don&#8217;t. <a href="https://www.uclalawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Schwartz-FP-1-How-Governments-Pay.pdf"><em>How Governments Pay: Lawsuits, Budgets, and Police Reform</em> (Joanna Schwartz&nbsp;2016)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Police departments rarely pay attention to lawsuits alleging officer misconduct. <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=888113013007027117118114009098019094032059000085054054113127081097111080097124123075026050063104107058097103095070011025024119058039008069063020028103121095004079055079001105010066005088126122083007120089115020074093076025126120001104094024114100007&amp;EXT=pdf"><em>Myths and Mechanics of Deterrence: The Role of Lawsuits in Enforcement Decisionmaking</em> (Joanna Schwartz&nbsp;2010)</a></p>

<h3 id="private-cause-of-action-under-1983">Private Cause of Action under §&nbsp;1983</h3>
<h4 id="standing-requirements">Standing&nbsp;Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To seek injunctive relief under § 1983, a plaintiff must show both (1) a likelihood of future harm, and (2) the existence of an official policy or its equivalent. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4587981977816900853#p105"><em>Los Angeles v. Lyons</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1983)</a> (denying injunctive relief to man subjected to unconstitutional, unprovoked chokehold by <span class="caps">LAPD</span> during vehicle&nbsp;stop)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In class action lawsuits, &#8220;unless the named plaintiffs are themselves entitled to seek injunctive relief, they may not represent a class seeking that relief.&#8221; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10993164981183849619#p1045"><em>Hodgers-Durgin v. De La Vina</em> (9th Cir. 1999)</a> (where named plaintiffs were unconstitutionally stopped by Border Patrol only once despite driving same stretch of road regularly for years, they did not satisfy <em>Lyons</em>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="proving-likelihood-of-future-injury">Proving Likelihood of Future&nbsp;Injury</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Easy to prove in suits against jail conditions, because of regular&nbsp;interaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It helps if plaintiffs need not break the law to experience the&nbsp;injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helps to construe the harm broadly. See e.g. <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/cacdce/2:2014cv01096/582771"><em>Meister v. City of Hawthorne</em> (<span class="caps">C.D.</span> Cal. 2014)</a> (&#8220;Plaintiffs allege that a statutory violation occurs upon every interaction between the <span class="caps">HPD</span> and its hearing-impaired residents, who are allegedly denied the benefits of <span class="caps">HPD</span> services because of their disability. The injury alleged is not speculative or contingent, but instead is exceedingly likely to afflict Meister and the other hearing-impaired residents of Hawthorne in the&nbsp;future.&#8221;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It helps when the harm results from an unconstitutional policy, and when plaintiffs have experienced the harm multiple times. See e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17839907099983072677#p161"><em>Nat&#8217;l Congress <span class="caps">PR</span> Rights v. City of New York</em> (<span class="caps">S.D.N.Y.</span> 1999)</a> (in stop-and-frisk class action, both these factors distinguished the case from <em>Lyons</em>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="proving-official-policy-or-its-equivalent">Proving Official Policy or its&nbsp;Equivalent</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>See <em>Monell</em> claims,&nbsp;infra.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <em>An v. City of New York</em>, plaintiff alleged First Amendment violation for arrest while filming police, but case was was dismissed for failure to show policy. Plaintiff amended complaint to add more examples of conduct, and case eventually settled with promise of&nbsp;training.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="prison-reform-in-nyc">Prison Reform In <span class="caps">NYC</span></h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Brought class-action suit <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8623335185089102413"><em>Sheppard v. Phoenix</em> (<span class="caps">S.D.N.Y.</span> 2002)</a> on behalf of prisoners at Rikers&#8217; segregation unit; entered consent judgment the eve of the trial, requiring change in use of force policies, supervision, staff discipline, installation of video cameras, etc. Four years of judicial supervision aided by expert consultants, terminated successfully. See <a href="https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://duckduckgo.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1351&amp;context=law_journal_law_policy#page=10">Boston p.163-65</a> (describing the&nbsp;process).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the Dept of Corrections didn&#8217;t extend the reforms outside the (court-required) segregation unit changes. Abuses persisted elsewhere, so plaintiffs brought <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2183692890702155990"><em>Ingles v. Toro</em>, (<span class="caps">S.D.N.Y.</span> 2006)</a> challenging abuses at other prisons and in Rikers. Entered private settlement agreement mandating cameras, changes to use-of-force policy, training and recruiting, force tacking system, etc. The settlement approval order noted with concern that private settlement agreement means enforcing compliance would require a new trial in state court with a new, unfamiliar&nbsp;judge.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>See <a href="./Day%203%20(Injunctive%20Relief)/Injunctive%20Relief%20and%20Reform/US%20v.%20Los%20Angeles%20%20Consent%20Decree.pdf"><span class="caps">U.S.</span> v. Los Angeles Consent Decree</a> (mandating many detailed changes to <span class="caps">LAPD</span> infrastructure and&nbsp;policies)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rushin says <span class="caps">LAPD</span> consent decree was successful; people&#8217;s opinions of <span class="caps">LAPD</span> went up, and use of force went down (though went back up after auditing stopped), even though overall street-level policing increased. But it took 12 years and there was considerable organizational&nbsp;buy-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Alamance, district judge rejected DoJ&#8217;s case as resting on sheriff&#8217;s statements and unpersuasive statistics about biased policing. Judge ignored troubling practices, like seeking info on immigration status of people not in custody, and firing officers who spoke&nbsp;out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-injunctions-operate">How Injunctions&nbsp;Operate</h3>
<p>Court retains jurisdiction over the case, and can exert at least 3 levels of&nbsp;pressure:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The court-appointed monitor ensures the defendant feels&nbsp;watched.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The judge can extend the oversight period. See <a href="https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/handle/1811/79757/1/OSJCL_V14N1_113.pdf">Rushin</a>, noting the 12-year length of supervising <span class="caps">LAPD</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Court can enter sanctions or hold the defendant in contempt. It&#8217;s rare, and requires essentially a whole new&nbsp;trial.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It can be helpful to build community oversight requirements into a consent decree. The requirements will eventually expire, but there will hopefully be political costs to abolishing the&nbsp;oversight.</p>

<h2 id="qualified-immunity">Qualified&nbsp;Immunity</h2>
<p>Qualified Immunity was invented by the Supreme Court in <em>Pierson v. Ray</em>, 386 <span class="caps">U.S.</span> 547 (1967), on the theory that Congress intended to incorporate a common-law good faith defense to false&nbsp;arrest.</p>

<p>Qualified Immunity applies only to claims against individuals for money damages. No <span class="caps">QI</span> for municipalities or injunctive&nbsp;relief.</p>

<p>Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense, and defendants most often raise it at the summary judgment&nbsp;stage.</p>

<p>Some courts have denied immunity to private actors. Supreme court has denied qualified immunity to private prison guard.

<h4 id="what-constitutes-a-policy-or-custom">What constitutes a &#8220;policy or&nbsp;custom?&#8221;</h4>

<h5 id="1-official-policy">1. Official&nbsp;Policy</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A municipality&#8217;s official policy can be a basis for § 1983 liability. See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2958398500325696309"><em>Monell</em></a>(department had unconstitutional policy of requiring pregnant employees to take maternity leave&nbsp;early)</p>

<li>
<p>This is the rarest case, but the easiest to prove when it&nbsp;happens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="2-a-decision-by-a-person-with-final-policy-making-authority">2. A Decision by a Person with Final Policy-Making&nbsp;Authority</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who the final policy maker is is a question of&nbsp;law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where it&#8217;s based on the decision of a subordinate, the final policy maker must approve the decision as well as the basis for it. There was a case that found no municipal liability where final policymaker essentially just said, &#8220;I trust your judgment.&#8221; Citation&nbsp;needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="3-a-custom-or-practice">3. A Custom or&nbsp;Practice</h5>
<p>This is the most common type of <em>Monell</em> claim, and includes claims premised on failure to train, discipline, supervise, or&nbsp;screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Must show high &#8216;deliberate indifference&#8217;&nbsp;standard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A municipality can be liable under § 1983 for failure to train if the need for training is &#8220;obvious,&#8221; e.g. the need to give police use-of-force training before sending them out with guns, charged with suspects. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1913790172308662115"><em>City of Canton v. Harris</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1989)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But a pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees is &#8220;ordinarily necessary&#8221; to demonstrate deliberate indifference for purposes of failure to train. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16887528200611439212"><em>Connick v.

<h4 id="thoughts-on-municipal-liability">Thoughts on Municipal&nbsp;Liability</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In one judge&#8217;s experience, most <em>Monell</em> claims are brought so as to find a deep pocket, avoid juries&#8217; unwillingness to award substantial damages against individuals, and expand the scope of admissible evidence. But indemnification, issue preclusion, and bifurcated trials frustrate these goals and make many <em>Monell</em> claims a waste of time. See <a href="https://via.library.depaul.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1700&amp;context=law-review"><em>The Importance and Overuse of Policy and Custom Claims: A View From One Trench</em> (David F. Hamilton&nbsp;1999)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But <em>Monell</em> claims are still helpful where qualified immunity is likely to go to the jury (?), where indemnification is unavailable, and where the harm results from a municipality&#8217;s budgeting decisions. <em>Id.</em></p>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>[T]he current practice of bifurcation virtually ensures that potentially meritorious <em>Monell</em> claims will die on the vine, because an award of compensatory damages against an individual officer makes the plaintiff whole, and there is nothing left to pursue against the municipality.&#8221; <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/geolr35&amp;i=861"><em>In Defense of Making Government Pay</em> (Myriam E.

<h3 id="supervisory-liability">Supervisory&nbsp;Liability</h3>
<p>Before <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</em>, a supervisory liability claim generally required showing two things:
1. that the supervisory defendant either acquiesced in or was deliberately indifferent to the subordinate&#8217;s unconstitutional conduct; and
2. that the supervisor&#8217;s action or inaction was &#8220;affirmatively linked&#8221; to the deprivation of the plaintiff&#8217;s federal rights.&#8221; <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2014/Section-1983-Litigation-3D-FJC-Schwartz-2014.pdf#page=127"><em>Section 1983 Litigation</em> p.115</a>.</p>
<p>But now &#8220;[I]n a § 1983 suit or a <em>Bivens</em> action—where masters do not answer for the torts of their servants—the term &#8216;supervisory liability&#8217; is a misnomer. Absent vicarious liability, each Government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct. In the context of determining whether there is a violation of a clearly established right to overcome qualified immunity, <strong>purpose rather than knowledge is required to impose</strong> <em>Bivens</em> <strong>liability on the subordinate</strong> for unconstitutional discrimination; <strong>the same holds true for an official charged with violations arising from his or her superintendent responsibilities.</strong>&#8221; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16725752296468120395"><em>Ashcroft v.

<p>No single standard has emerged since <em>Iqbal</em>; some circuits have taken it to mean that the supervisor&#8217;s required level of culpability shifts based on the underlying violation, whereas others have just raised the standard more vaguely. See <a href="https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1683&amp;context=jcl">Patrick Boynton, <em>Supervisory Liability in the Circuit Courts After Iqbal</em> (Patrick Boynton 2018)</a>; see also <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2014/Section-1983-Litigation-3D-FJC-Schwartz-2014.pdf#page=267"><em>Section 1983 Litigation</em> n.1028</a> (summarizing various circuits&#8217;&nbsp;approaches).</p>

<h2 id="attorneys-fees">Attorneys&#8217;&nbsp;Fees</h2>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>In any action or proceeding to enforce [§ 1983, among others], the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party &#8230; a reasonable attorney&#8217;s fee as part of the costs &#8230;&#8221; <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1988">42 <span class="caps">U.S.C.</span>§ 1988(b)</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Previously, &#8216;prevailing party&#8217; just meant catalyzing the desired change. Now, a party must secure a judgment on the merits or a settlement agreement that is enforced through a consent decree. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18016879269718488474"><em>Buckhannon Board <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Care Home, Inc. v. <span class="caps">W.V.</span> Dept. of Health and Human Resources</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span>&nbsp;2001).</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.&#8221; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5179727217217722884"><em>Hensley v. Eckerhart</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1983)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the plaintiff fails to prevail on a claim, the hours spent on it should be excluded from calculation if the claim is unrelated to the plaintiff&#8217;s successful claims. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5179727217217722884#p440"><em>Id.</em></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although the amount of damages awarded &#8220;is one of many factors that a court should consider in calculating an award of attorney&#8217;s fees&#8221; under § 1988, there is no requirement that an award of attorneys&#8217; fees be proportional to the damages awarded to the plaintiff. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8789673379809042125#r[17]"><em>Riverside v. Rivera</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1986)</a> (emphasizing § 1988&#8217;s purpose to encourage bringing suits that benefit the public and validate important&nbsp;rights)</p>

<p>Attorney fee motions and rulings are full of nitpicking. See, e.g., <em>Jones v. Cty. of Sacramento</em>, No. <span class="caps">CIV</span> S-09-1025 <span class="caps">DAD</span> (<span class="caps">E.D.</span> Cal. 2011) (devoting a paragraph to 0.1 hours of telephone conversation); see also <em>Perrin v. Goodrich</em>, No. <span class="caps">ED</span> <span class="caps">CV</span> 08-00595 <span class="caps">LLP</span> (SSx) (<span class="caps">E.D.</span> Cal. 2012) (defendants argued that plaintiff&#8217;s fees should be reduced 25% for half-hour block billing, but presence of some half-hour and hour-long intervals was probably&nbsp;coincidence)</p>

<li>
<p>Declarations from fellow attorneys in the field, e.g. Carol Sobel, are very helpful in getting fee&nbsp;awards.</p>

<h4 id="fees-and-settlements">Fees and&nbsp;Settlements</h4>
<p>Plaintiffs can waive attorneys&#8217; fees in settlements, including class-action settlements. See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17948293160115901520"><em>Evans v. Jeff D.</em> (<span class="caps">U.S.</span> 1986)</a>.</p>

<li>that fee-shifting only affects the market for plaintiffs with good-liability/bad-damages cases;&nbsp;and</li>
<li>that an <em>Evans</em> offer can usually be effective as a defense negotiation strategy only in good-liability/bad-damages cases. What <em>Evans</em> does, then, is to reverse the rationale for&nbsp;fee-shifting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="regional-variation">Regional&nbsp;Variation</h2>
<p>Areas vary wildly in their hospitality to civil rights claims, based on &#8220;actors (including plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys, state and federal judges, state and federal juries, and defense counsel), legal rules and remedies (including state tort law, Section 1983 doctrine and defenses, and damages caps), and informal practices (which can include litigation, settlement, and indemnification decisions).&#8221; <a href="https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6085&amp;context=mlr"><em>Civil Rights Ecosystems</em> (Joanna Schwartz&nbsp;2020)</a></p>
<p>California state civil rights laws, especially the Bane Act, can be very helpful supplements (or alternatives) to federal Section 1983 claims. <a href="https://www.vjamesdesimonelaw.com/using-californias-civil-code-to-prosecute-civil-rights-cases/"><em>Using California&#8217;s Civil Code to Prosecute Civil Rights Cases</em>(Jim&nbsp;DeSimone)</a></p>
