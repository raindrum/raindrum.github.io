  <h2 class="posttitle">New website just dropped!</h2>
  <div><b>May 31, 2021</b></div>
  <p>It's been a while since my last post about my citation lookup software, so I figured I ought to post an update on the development status. The biggest news is that it has its own website now: citation.link! It can do the same citation lookups that Law Search does …</p>

  <div><b>Feb 25, 2021</b></div>
  <p>I've been working more on my citation lookup program, and I'm happy to announce you can now use it to look up state laws! Previously, apart from court cases, it only covered federal and California law. Now, it can look up statutes for every U.S. state and territory except …</p>

  <div><b>Dec 16, 2020</b></div>
  <p>I wrote this term paper in LAW 507: Labor Law and Social Policy. It's pretty dry, but it's worth a read if you like learning how some very technical parts of federal labor law are very outdated in the modern economy, to the detriment of workers' right to organize. Secondary …</p>

  <h2 class="posttitle">I Made a Search Engine to Look up Legal Citations!</h2>
  <div><b>Nov 17, 2020</b></div>
  <p>I've integrated the lookup tools I'd been working on into one unified search engine for legal citations. It reads a citation and tries to pull up the relevant statute or legal opinion. If you reference a subsection of a law, it'll try to go directly to that. Same for pincites …</p>

  <div><b>Sep 12, 2020</b></div>
  <p>When I was working at the Eviction Defense Network this past summer, one of my jobs was to put together jury documents---that is, sets of documents that would be shared with opposing counsel and eventually the court in preparation for jury trials. One aspect of this was to collect all …</p>

  <div><b>Aug 11, 2020</b></div>
  <p>These are my organized notes from Suing The Police, a two-week class I took at UCLA Law in January 2020, with Professor Joanna Schwartz. I've tried to add hyperlinks to to various sources, so it might be helpful as a jumping-off point for research. Needless to say, nothing here is …</p>

  <div><b>Jul 26, 2020</b></div>
  <p>Maggie Gaffney, Michelle Zhang, Ilan Zur and I wrote this report for a class in the Fall 2019 semester at UCLA Law. Many thanks to Victor Narro and Ana Luz Gonzalez of the UCLA Labor Center, who provided invaluable assistance. As part of the report we used an online tool …</p>
