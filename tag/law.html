  <div><b>Dec 16, 2020</b></div>
  <p>I wrote this term paper in LAW 507: Labor Law and Social Policy. It's pretty dry, but it's worth a read if you like learning how some very technical parts of federal labor law are very outdated in the modern economy, to the detriment of workers' right to organize. Secondary …</p>

  <h2 class="posttitle">I Made a Search Engine to Look up Legal Citations!</h2>

  <p>Maggie Gaffney, Michelle Zhang, Ilan Zur and I wrote this report for a class in the Fall 2019 semester at UCLA Law. Many thanks to Victor Narro and Ana Luz Gonzalez of the UCLA Labor Center, who provided invaluable assistance. As part of the report we used an online tool …</p>
