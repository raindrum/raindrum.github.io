  <div><b>May 31, 2021</b></div>
  <p>It's been a while since my last post about my citation lookup software, so I figured I ought to post an update on the development status. The biggest news is that it has its own website now: citation.link! It can do the same citation lookups that Law Search does …</p>

  <div><b>Sep 12, 2020</b></div>
