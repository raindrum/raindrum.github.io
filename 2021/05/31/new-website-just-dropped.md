It's been a while since [my last post](../2021-02-25 Law Search supports state laws now!.md) about my citation lookup software, so I figured I ought to post an update on the development status.

The biggest news is that it has its own website now: **[citation.link](https://www.citation.link)**!

It can do the same citation lookups that [Law Search](../../../lawsearch) does, but it's running my actual [CiteURL](../../../citeurl) code instead of a stripped-down JavaScript port of it. In other words, there's a lot more room to grow and give it more features.

The main difference right now, besides the look, is that [you can use it](https://www.citation.link/parser) to detect and hyperlink all the citations in a block of text. Eventually I'll be adding more features as well. If you've been using Law Search, I recommend switching over to the new site!

And now, back to studying for the bar exam.
