I'm Simon Raindrum Sherred, a recent UCLA Law graduate with a background in sociology and a focus on workers' and tenants' rights. These days I'm studying for the California bar exam.

I write code in my free time. You can find my projects on [on GitHub](https://github.com/raindrum). I also enjoy juggling.
