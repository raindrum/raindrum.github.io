My name is Simon Raindrum Sherred. I grew up in the Bay Area, studied sociology and legal studies at UCSC, and then law at UCLA. Nowadays, I'm proud to work as a staff attorney at the [Eviction Defense Network](https://edn.la) in Los Angeles.

In my spare time, I write code. You can find most of my projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/raindrum). So far, the most ambitious one is [citation.link](https://www.citation.link), a website I built for looking up references to court opinions, statutes, and law review articles.

I also enjoy juggling.
