  <h2 class="posttitle">New website just dropped!</h2>
  <div><b>May 31, 2021</b></div>
  <p>It's been a while since my last post about my citation lookup software, so I figured I ought to post an update on the development status. The biggest news is that it has its own website now: citation.link! It can do the same citation lookups that Law Search does …</p>

  <h2 class="posttitle">Law Search supports state laws now!</h2>
  <div><b>Feb 25, 2021</b></div>
  <p>I've been working more on my citation lookup program, and I'm happy to announce you can now use it to look up state laws! Previously, apart from court cases, it only covered federal and California law. Now, it can look up statutes for every U.S. state and territory except …</p>

  <h2 class="posttitle">Secondary Boycotts in the Fissured Workplace</h2>
  <div><b>Dec 16, 2020</b></div>
  <p>I wrote this term paper in LAW 507: Labor Law and Social Policy. It's pretty dry, but it's worth a read if you like learning how some very technical parts of federal labor law are very outdated in the modern economy, to the detriment of workers' right to organize. Secondary …</p>

  <div><b>Nov 24, 2020</b></div>
  <p>UPDATE: Nowadays, I host an even fancier citation lookup tool at citation.link! Type a legal citation into the box below, and I'll try to send you to whatever it references: // This script was made with CiteURL v10.0.5, an extensible framework // to turn legal references into URLs. // // The …</p>

  <h2 class="posttitle">Site Update</h2>
  <div><b>Nov 24, 2020</b></div>
  <p>You might've noticed that this website looks totally different now! That's because I'm constitutionally incapable of letting things be. I migrated the site from Jekyll to Pelican, a different static site generator that runs on Python instead of Ruby. I've been meaning to switch over, because I do a lot …</p>

  <h2 class="posttitle">I Made a Search Engine to Look up Legal Citations!</h2>
  <div><b>Nov 17, 2020</b></div>
  <p>I've integrated the lookup tools I'd been working on into one unified search engine for legal citations. It reads a citation and tries to pull up the relevant statute or legal opinion. If you reference a subsection of a law, it'll try to go directly to that. Same for pincites …</p>

  <h2 class="posttitle">Exhibiter - A Python Program to Organize Evidence</h2>
  <div><b>Sep 12, 2020</b></div>
  <p>When I was working at the Eviction Defense Network this past summer, one of my jobs was to put together jury documents---that is, sets of documents that would be shared with opposing counsel and eventually the court in preparation for jury trials. One aspect of this was to collect all …</p>

  <h2 class="posttitle">Suing the Police</h2>
  <div><b>Aug 11, 2020</b></div>
  <p>These are my organized notes from Suing The Police, a two-week class I took at UCLA Law in January 2020, with Professor Joanna Schwartz. I've tried to add hyperlinks to to various sources, so it might be helpful as a jumping-off point for research. Needless to say, nothing here is …</p>

  <div><b>Jul 26, 2020</b></div>
  <p>Maggie Gaffney, Michelle Zhang, Ilan Zur and I wrote this report for a class in the Fall 2019 semester at UCLA Law. Many thanks to Victor Narro and Ana Luz Gonzalez of the UCLA Labor Center, who provided invaluable assistance. As part of the report we used an online tool …</p>

  <div><b>Jul 05, 2020</b></div>
  <p>I've decided to start a website to host my research and whatever else I may blog. With any luck, I'll post some actual content to it soon. In the meantime, there's not much to see here.</p>
